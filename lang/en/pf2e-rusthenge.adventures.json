Your group may be uncomfortable including themes of disease at your table–in such an event, you can recontextualize rust creep as a curse, a slowly-moving poison, or simply as a sinister transmutation effect born from a region of the Abyss. </p> </aside> <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Chapter 1: Message in the Night</h2> <p> The village of Osprey Cove has led a quiet, peaceful existence for decades. Though they rarely interact with their sibling village of Iron Harbor, things change forever the night a storm brings a dying messenger with an eerie warning. The PCs accompany an envoy from Osprey Cove to see what has become of Iron Harbor. Once there, an investigation soon reveals that the local temple of Gorum has been invaded by a sinister cult. </p> <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Chapter 2: The Rusted Ruin</h2> <p> After exposing the cult’s atrocities in the temple of Gorum, the PCs explore the strange subterranean complex under the ancient, rusted monoliths known as Rusthenge. Within these hidden chambers, the adventurers learn about the sinister cult’s primary aim: resurrecting a dead demon lord! </p> <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Chapter 3: Resurrection of Rust</h2> <p> As the PCs close in on the cultist leader, they learn of a complicated ritual he’s performing to resurrect Xar-Azmak, demon lord of rust and decay. The PCs must work against the building magic of this ritual, then finally confront the cultist at the edge of the Darklands before he can set into motion a series of events that could bring the demon lord back to life. </p> <section class=\"advancement-track\"> <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Advancement Track</h1> <p> <span class=\"level\">1</span> The PCs begin the adventure at level 1. </p> <p> <span class=\"level\">2</span> The PCs should reach level 2 before investigating Rusthenge and the first dungeon floor below. </p> <p> <span class=\"level\">3</span> The PCs should be level 3 before descending to the Temple of Xar-Azmak on the second level of Rusthenge.

In particular, the adventure focuses on a stretch along the isle’s southern shores—a region known as the Kindred Coast. This area is about a 20-hour trek south of the dangerous ruins of Old Xin-Edasseril, the one-time capital of Runelord Belimarius’s nation. For ages, Chakikoth Isle was one of several unclaimed islands in the Ironbound Archipelago, a region sandwiched between the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and the frontier of Varisia. The archipelago’s position beyond the borders of any nation’s rule made it an appealing destination for pioneers and settlers to set out for and establish new homes. Life in the Ironbound Archipelago was not easy, but to those who welcomed the challenge, the freedom to live as they wished was too great a draw to resist. </p> <p> In the year 4606 ar, at the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, a series of frightening storms scoured many parts of the world, and the pirate city of Riddleport in Varisia was no exception. Weeks after the storms cleared, two siblings, Dartanious and Santwi, took advantage of the chaos and disarray to flee their servitude at the hands of Riddleport’s crime lords. The military-minded Dartanious had been working on a plan to escape and was waiting for an appropriate diversion to put his plan into action. Meanwhile, Santwi had inspired their fellow captives, helping them to feel brave enough to attempt an escape in the chaos the storms left in their wake. </p> <p> Sailing in two ships they stole from the harbor, the siblings and their combined crews of nearly a hundred followers made their way north across the Shining Sea, eventually making landfall on the southern shore of Chakikoth Isle. Here, far from the cruelties of their hometown, the siblings and their crews started new lives. They founded a village called @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02optionalstar00#osprey-covesettlement-2], named after the birds that populated the shoreline. For nearly a year, things went well, but by the end of that time, the siblings’ bickering had resulted in a schism. Santwi, a worshipper of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.v67fHklTZ6LoU54q], wanted to continue developing Osprey Cove into a gentle, commune-style society of fishers and farmers, but Dartanious was a worshipper of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.88vRw2ZVPax4hhga]. He increasingly focused on plans to train a navy so that, one day, he could return to Riddleport to strike back at its crime lords. Before the two siblings and their followers came to blows, Dartanious gathered his followers and abandoned Osprey Cove. They traveled up the coast to establish a second village and named it @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02ironharbor0000#iron-harborsettlement-2]. </p> <p> For years, the two villages grew and prospered, slowly augmenting their populations with a trickle of newcomers searching for a place to start new lives. Each town’s leaders were gifted and charismatic, and their villagers were hardworking and loyal, but they rarely mixed. They established their own trade with villages on other islands in the archipelago, secured their own defenses and stores, and when they did think of each other, those thoughts were tainted with bitterness and suspicion. A sort of cold war escalated between the two settlements, a long-lasting feud that would outlive both siblings. Today, Dartanious and Santwi are long dead, but the villages of Osprey Cove and Iron Harbor live on. In honor of their founders, the locals refer to this stretch of Chakikoth’s shoreline as the Kindred Coast, yet their cooperation ends there. </p> <p> But with the rise of New Thassilon, life has changed for the people of the Kindred Coast. Thankfully, the new ruler of this region, Runelord Belimarius, is more concerned with her disputes with rival Queen Sorshen, power grabs against the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, and opposition from Varisia to the south. So far, she and her armies have not paid much mind to the smaller settlements that already existed in the Ironbound Archipelago when she returned to power in the region. The villagers realize this is mostly because Runelord Belimarius considers these villages to already be part of her domain. And this is how the people of Osprey Cove like it. When Runelord Belimarius and her agents turn their attention to Chakikoth Isle, it is invariably to the notorious ruins of Old Xin-Edasseril at the isle’s heart—a place the citizens of the Kindred Coast have long avoided. </p> <p> But once a year, a tax collector visits the Kindred Coast to gather dues for the capital of New Xin-Edasseril, located four islands to the northeast. The tithes they demand are light, and while the villagers still rankle at having to pay taxes to anyone, they also realize that the less attention they draw from Runelord Belimarius, the better. To their relief, the tax collectors always seem eager to conduct their business quickly and never even stay the night in town, and so far they have left Osprey Cove and Iron Harbor alone to conduct business as usual. </p> <p> Still, the leaders of Osprey Cove fear that they’re living on borrowed time, and talk about abandoning the Kindred Coast to seek a new home further abroad has been circulating in town. Until the town can reach a decision, though, the villagers do their best to lie low and not cause a scene, so that they will continue to be beneath the notice of their land’s ancient overlord. Unfortunately, something that has festered for a long time in the hinterlands of the Kindred Coast is about to threaten that status quo. </p>"

The villagers are right to avoid the place, for its history is sinister indeed. </p> <p> Many years before Earthfall, the demon lord of rust, Xar-Azmak, was slain during his devastating attack on the infernal city of Dis, but not before he and his demonic armies left many buildings in rusted ruins. One of the demon lord’s most devoted cultists, a man named Theiltemar, fled the battlefield in Hell with a relic snatched from Xar-Azmak’s dying body—an artifact that would become known as the <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06405advent.JournalEntryPage.05thehornofrus00#horn-of-rust]</em>. Theiltemar returned to the Material Plane and to his homeland of Thassilon, where he went into hiding for several years, but when it became apparent that Dispater’s armies weren’t looking for him, Theiltemar set into motion a plot to resurrect Xar-Azmak. He convinced Runelord Belimarius to fund the construction of an underground research facility where he proposed he would study the properties of various skymetals to aid in her own research. Belimarius fell for it, and within a few years, a series of metal towers Theiltemar called the Vloric Spires shone on the southern shores of the nation of Edasseril. Theiltemar set his minions and apprentices to work studying skymetals, but he focused his own research on methods by which he could use Xar-Azmak’s horn to resurrect the demon lord. </p> <p> But then disaster struck. Earthfall took Thassilon apart at the seams, and much of the nation of Edasseril sunk below the waves. While the region surrounding the Vloric Spires remained above the waters, the spires themselves crumbled, leaving behind nothing but a ring of jagged metal spikes. Theiltemar and his favored minions remained in the underground levels below, where they survived for several years until finally succumbing to internal strife and self-destruction. </p> <p> For many thousands of years, the aboveground ruins of the Vloric Spires lay forgotten. Like most Thassilonian ruins, the Vloric Spires and the chambers below had been protected by preservative magic intended to combat the passage of time, but the damage done to the upper reaches of the spires left them less protected. Over the ages, they grew rusted and pitted. The spires were visible from ships that sailed close to the southern reaches of Chakikoth Isle, and sailors took to calling the place Rusthenge. Even after settlers came and established two villages on the Kindred Coast, the site was avoided, for the place shed an uncanny aura that made animals violent, flora unpleasant, and sent periodic strange humming sounds up from below. </p> <p> When the time-locked city of Xin-Edasseril was restored to the modern timeline and New Thassilon became one of Avistan’s newest nations, many of its citizens struggled with reintegrating into the new world. One such person is Meitremar, grandson of Theiltemar. To him, memories of his grandfather remained fresh in his mind after spending so long trapped in time. Eager to track down his grandfather’s legacy and finish what he started, Meitremar chartered a ship and sailed to the Kindred Coast. Delighted to find a settlement not far from Rusthenge, he and his followers infiltrated Iron Harbor and, using a mix of bribery, threats, and magic, took control. For the past few days, Meitremar has been establishing a new cult to Xar-Azmak in the chambers below Rusthenge in hopes of discovering his grandfather’s remains, reclaiming the <em>Horn of Rust</em>, and picking up where his grandfather’s plans to resurrect the Sin of Steel left off. </p>"

As the PCs progress in this adventure, they may encounter NPCs who might be willing to tell them some or all of Blanton’s sorry final days. </p> </aside> <p> The night before this adventure begins, a storm lashes the Kindred Coast, and the citizens of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02optionalstar00#osprey-covesettlement-2] spend the evening sheltering indoors with hot drinks, cozy companionship, and tale-telling, as has been the tradition for years during such events. The next morning, one of the village elders makes a startling discovery—a man, near death, lies collapsed in the middle of the one road leading into town. Just before he perishes, he gasps out an unsettling warning—something dreadful has happened in Iron Harbor, Osprey Cove’s sibling settlement. </p> <p> When your players create characters for Rusthenge, each should consider choosing a background from those presented @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06405advent.JournalEntryPage.05rusthengebac00].

The players should also be familiar with the background of the two villages (Osprey Cove and Iron Harbor), their shared history, and the current silent animosity between the two, as detailed at the start of this adventure. </p> <p> The following read-aloud text is meant to quickly summarize the situation that leads the PCs to being on the road to Iron Harbor; once you read this text to the PCs, you can proceed immediately to them approaching area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02acryforhelp000] of Kindred’s Crossing. Alternatively, you can use this text as a guideline to present these events in play as an extended roleplaying encounter with the PCs, as detailed on the next page. </p> <div class=\"read-aloud\"> <p> An unusual surprise came to Osprey Cove the morning after the storm. On an early dawn walk to appraise the storm damage, Elder Johedia found a dying man sprawled at the edge of town. Suffering from exposure, two infected crossbow bolt wounds, and a strange sickness that left rust-red splotches all over his body, the man gasped out an unsettling warning before he died: “Iron Harbor... rust... ship... all dead... before... too late... ” </p> <p> The man was dressed in rusted armor and clutched an equally rusted religious symbol of Gorum in one hand. This, and his final words, suggested something dreadful had happened in the nearby village of Iron Harbor. Osprey Cove’s youngest leader, Elder Ordwi, quickly organized an expedition to travel the daylong trip east to Iron Harbor, both to offer help as needed, but also to extend overtures of peace, to bring an end to the yearslong feud that has kept the only two villages of the Kindred Coast at odds. Whether you volunteered or were recruited, your group is now well on their way along the Old Coast Road as Elder Ordwi’s escorts.

The Old Bridge</h2> <p class=\"read-aloud\"> Two weatherworn stone statues stand on either side of a fifteen-foot-wide rift in the shore, extending their arms toward one another. A partially completed, partially eroded old stone bridge doesn’t quite cross the gulf. In the water fifteen feet below, the surf crashes on a worn wedge of stone that might have at one time been part of the bridge. </p> <p> When Santwi and Dartanious agreed to work together and build the Coast Road (now the Old Coast Road), they began work on a stone bridge over a gap in the natural stone of the peninsula. This bridge originally featured four stone pillars, two which were carved to resemble Santwi and Dartanious holding the top of the bridge’s railing and facing out towards the water. Over the last century, erosion has marred the faces of these statues clean. </p> <p> For many years, @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02optionalstar00#osprey-covesettlement-2] attempted to keep the bridge in good repair, but the town has generally ignored it for the past decade. A wooden bridge replacement was scavenged long ago by @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02ironharbor0000#iron-harborsettlement-2] for use in building roofs and ships. When Blanton reached this location on his desperate journey to Osprey Cove, he was pursued by a pair of deros sent by the cult to prevent him from reaching his destination, and in a desperate gambit he leapt into the sea on the southern side and swam through the surf to the northern gap. This conflict took place at sunrise, so the dero had no choice but to retreat to area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02shelteredled00]. Exhausted from his sickness, the two poisoned bolt strikes he suffered, and the harrowing swim, it took Blanton the rest of the day to stagger his way to Osprey Cove. </p> <p> This area acts as a skill challenge to test the PCs’ creativity and ingenuity to find a way across. The most likely solutions are summarized below—each skill check made to cross the gap should be a DC 15 check (unless the attempt is particularly dangerous, such as tightrope walking). </p> <p> <strong>Climbing and Swimming:</strong> A PC can Climb 15 feet down to the water, then Swim across the 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep tide pool, then Climb 15 feet back up on the opposite side. A PC could also Climb around the northeastern edge of the gap, avoiding the water entirely, but doing so takes longer. The water is deep enough that a 15-foot-fall inflicts no damage; a character can halt a fall by Grabbing an Edge with a @Check[reflex|dc:15|traits:manipulate,action:grab-an-edge|name:Grab an Edge] save.<br /> Skill checks: @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb] to Climb, @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:swim|name:Swim] to Swim </p> <p> <strong>Jumping:</strong> A PC can attempt a Long Jump to cross the ravine at its narrowest point near the steep northern ridge. Doing so requires the PC to cover the 15-foot gap with a @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:long-jump|name:Long Jump] check (and at least 10 feet of distance covered before the Long Jump is attempted). A PC whose Speed is at least 30 feet can cover the gap automatically with a single Leap. </p> <p> <strong>Using a Rope:</strong> The PCs can throw a lasso or a grappling hook over the far statue, pull the rope tight, and then anchor the near side of the rope to the adjacent statue. Anchoring the rope is a secret ranged attack roll using the PC’s highest proficiency against AC 20 (on a critical failure, the grappling hook or lasso appears to be anchored, but pulls free once a PC is halfway across). Using a rope tied in this way allows a PC to cross the gap by clambering and clinging to the rope with a @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb] check or a @Check[acrobatics|dc:30|traits:move,skill,action:balance|name:Balance] check to Balance as they tightrope walk across the gap. </p> <p> <strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.tO46DP0MnaEzL54l]<br /> On the eastern side of the bridge, a single bolt from a hand crossbow is embedded in a wooden post near the bridgeworks. An examination of the bolt confirms it to be the same size capable of inflicting the wound found on Blanton’s body, and if it’s extracted from the pole and examined, tiny traces of giant centipede venom that remained on the bolt (and avoided being washed away by the rain as a result of being lodged in the wood) can be identified with a successful @Check[crafting|dc:15|traits:concentrate,exploration,secret,skill,action:identify-alchemy|name:Identify Alchemy] check to Identify Alchemy. </p> <p><strong>Reward:</strong> Grant the PCs 40 XP for getting past the broken bridge.</p>"

If the PCs do notice the ledge, the slope leading up to it can be clambered up by treating it as greater difficult terrain, but it doesn’t require an Athletics check to Climb. Should they do so, they’ll face the ledge’s occupants on even footing. </p> <p> If the PCs don’t notice the ledge and walk on by, then the dero keeping watch from above takes a shot at the last PC in the line with her hand crossbow, hoping to catch that target flat-footed and deal sneak attack damage. Each time she misses, give the PCs a @Check[perception|dc:5] check to hear the sound of the crossbow bolt striking something nearby. A critical success on this check allows a PC to realize the shot came from the ledge above. </p> <p> If every character in the party is using the Avoid Notice exploration activity, allow each PC (and Ordwi) to attempt secret @Check[stealth|dc:16|traits:move,skill,secret,exploration,action:avoid-notice|name:Avoid Notice] checks (these checks are against the giant centipedes’ Perception DC). If all the PCs succeed, they avoid the encounter entirely. </p> <p> The ledge itself is shaded by an overhanging lip of stone, which keeps the area in deep shadow except for a few hours during the morning. </p> <p> <strong>Creatures:</strong> When Blanton fled @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02optionalstar00#osprey-covesettlement-2], he left in the dead of night, hoping to avoid being observed. He wasn’t so lucky, and a pair of deros who work for the cult of Xar-Azmak were sent in pursuit of him. The deros and their trained giant centipedes caught up to Blanton just before sunrise as he was taking stock of the bridge at area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02theoldbridge00]. The deros opened fire on him, and he got off a few shots from his shortbow, wounding both of them before his bowstring broke. Desperate, Blanton leapt into the sea. With the sun rising in minutes and not eager to follow Blanton’s plunge, the two deros retreated to this ledge, but even pressed against the far wall they were forced to endure six hours of painful burns from exposure to sunlight. One of the two dero perished before the storm rolled in and blocked the sunlight enough to save the surviving dero, who had fallen unconscious from her wounds. </p> <p> This dero, Sydri, woke from unconsciousness in the dead of night at the height of the storm. Astounded by the wrath of the surface world’s weather and unsure of how many hours she had until the next sunrise, she left the safety of her ledge long enough to gather up several boughs and clumps of shrubbery. By the time the sun rose again, she was able to retreat into near darkness under a shelter made of the shrubbery, with her dead companion’s clothing draped over the framework. Her plan is to wait for nightfall before making her way back to Iron Harbor, but when the PCs pass by on the road below that afternoon, she can’t resist the urge to attack them, reasoning that even if they aren’t going to investigate Iron Harbor, at least they might have food and supplies to help her recover from her near-death experience. </p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <div class=\"encounter-image-wrapper\"> <img style=\"transform: scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-rusthenge/assets/tokens/Sydri.webp\"> </div> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Sheltered Ledge</span> <span class=\"keepme\">Moderate 1</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.0qGYozu96uCyqwwv] @UUID[Actor.ShWcSAzHjKnQ8MJX]</span> </div> <p> Once the fight begins, Sydri remains up on her ledge, unwilling to climb down into the direct sunlight (although unless the battle takes an hour, she won’t take further damage from exposure to the sun). She commands her pet giant centipedes to clamber down to attack the PCs while she continues firing on them with her hand crossbow. She switches to her aklys if a PC attempts to scramble up to her ledge, attempting to trip them. Sydri fights to the death, but if captured alive and the PCs can establish communication with her (note she only speaks Aklo and Undercommon), she’s willing to trade information for her release, but even then she’s misleading as she doesn’t wish to reveal much about her cult allies. She attempts to Lie to the PCs, fabricating a story about how she and her companion (nodding her head to the badly sunlight-burned, naked, dead dero slumped against the back wall of the overhung ledge) emerged into the surface world from a narrow fissure up higher in the ridge, then attacked a man who passed by on the road, intending to capture him alive and drag him back down to the dark for experimentation on to how he could withstand the sun’s light. If confronted with her lies, she grows quiet and sullen and speaks no more—taking her first chance to escape, even if it means fleeing through the sunlight. It’s likely only through magic, like <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6]</em>, that the PCs will be able to make Sydri helpful, at which point what she might have to reveal to the PCs is up to you. </p> <p> Note that Sydri’s weak condition is the result of her wounds and exposure to too much sunlight. If she escapes back to Iron Harbor and has a chance to rest for a full 24 hours while underground, she loses the weak creature adjustments. </p> </section> <p> <strong>Reward:</strong> If that party avoids this ambush completely, grant the party XP as if they defeated the monsters in battle in this event. </p>"

Most of the buildings are plain-looking, single-story stone structures with wood-shingled roofs, and are a mix of simple homes, workshops, general stores, smoking houses for fish (the village’s primary food source), and the like.

She holds up her hand to indicate the party should stop, then introduces herself as Sister Vanda before asking the group what their purpose is. Sister Vanda is, in fact, a fallen Gorumite.

This causes Vanda’s expression to shift from wariness to surprise for a moment, and she decides to take the woman she considers an enemy leader as a prisoner, leaving the PCs (whom she foolishly assumes are mere servants) to fend for themselves.

I’ll need you to come with me to Stonehome—Lord Ragnulf would wish to speak to one of the leaders of Osprey Cove about Brother Blanton, but also about the future of the Kindred Coast. There is much to discuss, and we can accommodate you alone at Stonehome for the night, but the rest of you must wait here in town.” </p> </div> <p> Elder Ordwi nods in understanding, then explains she needs a moment to speak privately to the PCs first. Sister Vanda huffs a little impatiently, but then nods in understanding and steps away, allowing the PCs a chance to speak to their friend.

Elder Ordwi picked up on this as well, and confides the following quietly to the PCs. </p> <p class=\"read-aloud\"> “Something’s going on here. Did you notice how she seemed surprised to find out about our visitor? And that Thassilonian ship in the harbor—that has to mean something as well. Parting ways here for the evening gives you a golden opportunity to learn more. I’ll accompany this Sister Vanda up to meet with Lord Ragnulf, but you all should look around the village a bit. Keep an eye out. Ask questions. Find somewhere to stay the night. Figure out what that Thassilonian ship is here for. But above all, be discreet!” </p> <p> Once she’s had her say, Ordwi smiles and calls Sister Vanda over again, and with a final nod to the PCs, the pair head off toward @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02stonehome00001], leaving the party to themselves. After Elder Ordwi leaves the PCs, it’s up to them what to do next. Iron Harbor is not a large village, but there are several areas of interest they could investigate.

Apart from those Thassilonians that came in a week ago and then shacked up in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02stonehome00001], things have been fine hereabouts lately. No strange sickness spreading that I know about. Wait. Should I know about something?” (If the PCs describe Blanton’s symptoms, she sighs in relief and reports that no one in town’s had anything close to that—not even those who get sick from visiting the spires in the first place.) </p> <p> <strong>Can you tell us about Stonehome?</strong> “Place is run by the Gorumites. Not my deal, but I appreciate the stability they bring. They like to fight and think the best person at fighting is the best person to be in charge. Seems weird to me, but it’s not my religion. Place has been quiet for the last week, though, ever since them Thassilonians showed up. Fine with me. Fewer Gorumites on the street means less clanking armor and, more importantly, less noisy praying. But still—it’s not normal for them to be shut in this long.” </p> <p> <strong>What’s with the ship in the harbor?</strong> “That Thassilonian thing? Belongs to a merchant, I hear. He and his entourage have been spending the last week in talks up at Stonehome. Who knows what they’re up to, but I’ve seen that there’s still some crew on the ship itself. None of ’em have come in to buy anything yet, which is just rude!” </p> <p> <strong>Could we stay the night here?</strong> “Figured we’d get here sooner or later. One of these days, someone’ll have to build a proper inn here in town, but in the meantime... Inn the meantime... get it? Ummm... Yeah.

Meitremar convinced Ragnulf that much of the metal on Chakikoth Isle was contaminated and pointed to Rusthenge as proof. Meitremar showed Ragnulf a ceramic flask that he explained was an old Thassilonian method to expose such contamination. He had Ragnulf gather the entire temple into the worship hall (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02worshiphall000]), then had him open the flask—and in doing so, exposed the Gorumites to his awful discovery: @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02rustcreep00000]. </p> <p> Roughly half of the Gorumites succumbed to the disease, and at Meitremar’s urging, Ragnulf called them out as harboring sin and ordered them to be taken into custody.

Each of these aristocrats represented a different affluent family from Magnimar: the Mindurians, the Valdemars, and the Vanderales; they hoped to develop a new settlement far north of Varisia’s Lost Coast. Construction of the three manors began at once, but the buildings weren’t quite complete before disaster struck Magnimar in the form of a devastating tsunami. Suddenly, protecting and repairing assets closer to home became a more important way to spend money and resources for these three aristocrats, and they abandoned their so-called “Chakikoth Project,” never to return. The three partially completed manors have been left ever since to slowly fall into ruin. The locals have since taken to calling the small compound of ruined mansions “Gold’s Ruin.” </p> <p> Within the three manors, there’s little to find other than musty and ruined furniture, seabird nests in the rafters, vermin nests below the floorboards, and half-finished houses direly in need of repair. The western manor (once a Mindurian project) is little more than a foundation, while the eastern manor (funded by the Vanderales) is partially collapsed. </p> <p> The central and smallest manor is the soundest of the trio, and while it includes a mostly leak-free roof, its interior walls are nothing more than a framework. This was the project of the Valdemars, and as the soundest remaining structure in Gold’s Ruin, has also been the home of a man named <strong>Derrol Finnick</strong> (CN male human architect 3) ever since the aristocrats abandoned the site. A 58-year-old man and a former architect from Magnimar, Derrol came to Iron Harbor with the Valdemars, but after a dispute about his pay, he abandoned his patron and attempted to move into Iron Harbor. By the time he realized how ill a fit he was among a town of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.88vRw2ZVPax4hhga] worshippers, his patron had left. He took up residence in the half-built manor, and after an ill-fated attempt to travel to @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02optionalstar00#osprey-covesettlement-2] met with a close call when attempting to cross the fallen bridge at @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02kindredcross00], he’s settled into a life in the ruins. Here, he’s managed a somewhat happy existence fishing and foraging for his food while living in the abandoned Valdemar estate. Derrol remains friendly and is eager for conversation, and if the PCs enter the manor, he quickly greets them. </p> <p class=\"read-aloud\"> “Derrol’s the name! Derrol Finnick. Used to be—well, used to be a lot of things, but most recently an underpaid architect and now just Derrol. These are my houses! The rest of the town doesn’t like them because they think they’re haunted, but I don’t mind. Ghosts never bothered me much, and there’s plenty of space. Not many visit Iron Harbor, but here you are! What can ol’ Derrol do for you?” </p> <p> As an outsider to the village, but one who still considers himself part of Iron Harbor on some level, Derrol can give the PCs a fair bit of additional information. Below are some of the PCs’ likely inquiries and Derrol’s responses. </p> <p> <strong>We’re from Osprey Cove.</strong> “I’ve always wanted to visit! Probably more to my liking than this place, from what I’ve heard. Iron Harbor’s got a tough name and tougher people, and it’s not really for me. I tried being tough and failed; I’d rather just fish and make art.” </p> <p> <strong>How’d you end up here?</strong> “I came in some years back with the Valdemars, but I got fed up with not getting paid my due. By the time I realized that the locals nearby are even less pleasant, the Valdemars had left me behind. Just been spending my time here since then—I guess they kind of forgot me. Now I just fish and explore and sometimes make little sculptures and carvings.” </p> <p> <strong>Do you know Blanton?</strong> “Nope. Name’s familiar, but... it’s been a while since I’ve been welcome in the village, and a lot of names have sorta run together in my head over the years.” </p> <p> <strong>What can you tell us about Stonehome?</strong> “Place is old, that’s for sure. Well, the lower portion is, at least. Upper works are pretty new, and not nearly so well made. Gorum’s not a god of architecture, but I suppose it works well enough for them. Interesting place though! I’ve long wondered about the interior...” (If he learns the PCs intend to infiltrate Stonehome, Derrol has some advice on how they can get into the structure if they promise to map out the interior for him; see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02enteringston00].) </p> <p> <strong>Do you know anything about a sickness or curse in the area?</strong> “They’ve always said @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03rusthenge00000] is cursed, but I think it’s just old and useless. No one needs an old metal monument of twisted rusty metal. Instead of saying ‘there’s a bunch of junk on that island,’ they say it’s cursed.” </p> <p> <strong>What do you know about the ship in the harbor?</strong> “Showed up about a week ago, and a delegation of Gorumites met them at the pier. I watched it from the cliff until they all headed up to Stonehome, and for the most part they haven’t come back out yet. Although I’ve been keeping an eye on them after dark on the nights when it’s not too stormy. Saw them unload a big crate from the ship in the middle of the night, but they carted it up to @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02thunderheadi00] instead of bringing it onto the mainland. And I’ve seen some weird lights up there too a few nights.” </p> <p> <strong>Tell us more about Thunderhead Isle/Rusthenge.</strong> “I stay away from the place—went there once years back and felt like I was being watched; that was enough for me! But lately, I’ve been seeing weird lights up there late at night. Nothing bright. Thought I was imagining it the first time. And I doubt you can see them at all from down in the village. But up here, on this cliff, you’ve got a better view of Rusthenge, and yeah. Weird lights. My take is that them Thassilonians are up to something there, and makes sense since Rusthenge is one of their old buildings anyway, yeah?” </p> <p> <strong>May we stay here with you?</strong> “Sure! There’s plenty of room. I recommend switching rooms every night, or the ghosts get angry and howl loudly.” (This is, of course, Derrol’s sense of humor, but the way the wind howls through the ruined buildings does tend to get creepy after dark.) </p> <p> <strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.slPGAdJR86h6DnaL]<br /> At some point during the visit, likely after Derrol’s gotten to know the PCs a bit more and knows they’re from Osprey Cove, he sheepishly asks if he can come with them when they go back home. He’s tired of living alone and wants to get back to village life “where the people are more friendly.” In an attempt to sweeten the deal, he offers the PCs a “bit o’ treasure I may have nicked from boss Valdemar once it became apparent he wasn’t gonna pay me what I was worth.” This is a tiny brass key set with small gemstones. The key doesn’t open any locks on the isle but is worth 20 gp. At your discretion, this key could play an important role in a future adventure—in particular, if you decide to continue this group’s adventures into <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em>, this could be the key to the mysterious clockwork songbird that the PCs will slowly reconstruct in that adventure. </p> <p><strong>Reward:</strong> Grant the PCs 40 XP if the PCs gain Derrol’s assistance in entering Stonehome.</p>"

While the total number of guards in Stonehome doesn’t change, it’s certainly possible for the PCs to encounter them in larger or smaller groups than those presented here. During play, make sure to keep an eye on encounters’ changing threat as guards move about and join fights, using the guidelines on page 489 of the Core Rulebook as an aid. </p> </aside> <p> The Gorumite temple of Stonehome is difficult to approach from the ground as the front gate is locked tight and sharp iron spikes deter folks from climbing the fence. No less than five @Check[thievery|dc:25|traits:manipulate,skill,action:pick-a-lock|name:Pick a Lock] checks are required to Pick the Lock at the front gate. A @Check[athletics|dc:30|traits:attack,skill,action:force-open|name:Force Open] check is required to Force Open the sturdy gate. The spiked wall is 20 feet high, and while it’s only a @Check[athletics|dc:20|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb] check to Climb it, the spikes are both difficult terrain and hazardous terrain that inflicts [[/r 4d6[piercing]]] damage (@Check[reflex|dc:20|basic:true] save) each time a creature attempts to climb through them. </p> <p> However, there are three safer routes into the compound, each of which can be revealed to the PCs by one of three potential sources in Iron Harbor—each of whom also asks the PCs for a specific favor once they get inside Stonehome. </p> <p> <strong>Derrol:</strong> As an architect, Derrol has insight into the structure. He shares that it’s well defended from the ground but neglects defense from above. Stonehome’s position nestled within a steep nook in the cliffside leaves it open to infiltration from above. Derrol can point out the safest route up the cliffs to a narrow ledge that sits 20 feet over the rooftop (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02rooftoprange00]). Without his aid, a PC who spends 4 hours Investigating the area surrounding Stonehome can spot this route with a @Check[architecture-lore|dc:15] or a @Check[perception|dc:20] check. The route can be made without any Athletics checks to climb until that last 20 feet, when a @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb]{Climb} check is required to scale the cliff down to a point where a character can safely step off onto the rooftop. Note that if the PCs make this approach without being stealthy, the occupants of the roof and possibly the dueling balcony (areas @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02rooftoprange00] and @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02duelingbalco00], respectively) are likely to notice them. </p> <p> <strong>Elsie:</strong> Before Stonehome locked down, Elsie had been paying daily visits to the stables (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02stables0000000]) to nurse one of the temple’s rosethorn rams back to health. She tells the PCs she’s concerned that the animal has been suffering this past week without medication—if the poor thing is even still alive. She gives the PCs a biscuit-shaped dose of medicine to feed to Ida the rosethorn, but she also indicates that if the PCs can rescue her and bring her back to Elsie, that would be even better. She’s never been in the structure itself, but on her many trips through the courtyard, she noticed the small well on the opposite side of the yard from the stables. She suspects that the well connects to an underground stream that empties into Iron Harbor just east of town, and can direct the PCs to this location (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02streamoutlet00]). </p> <p> <strong>Janis:</strong> Worried for her captain, Janis asks the PCs to infiltrate Stonehome and rescue him—or at least bring word of his fate (with his distinctive hat as evidence) if he’s beyond rescue. She’s spent some time studying Stonehome from afar through a spyglass and warns the PCs against attempts to climb the spiked walls, but she gives them a possible alternate way to enter the well-defended structure. Every sunrise and sunset, the guard posted at the edge of town changes. Two nights ago, Janis crept up to the guard who stood watch at the edge of town and pickpocketed their key. She stole away, made a quick impression of it in wax, and then managed to return the key to the guard’s belt without them noticing. While she hasn’t yet had the chance to put the mold to use (in part because she worries about leaving the <em>Swordfish</em> for the amount of time an infiltration would require), she’ll entrust the mold to the PCs if they agree to help find her captain. With the mold and an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.y34yjumCFakrbtdw] (which can be purchased in town for 4 gp), an hour’s work and a @Check[crafting|dc:15] check can create a new key capable of unlocking the front gate. </p>"

During the day’s low tides (a one-hour window that starts at 6:00 am and then again at 6:00 pm), one can walk along the southern peninsula through tide pools and exposed rocks, but at all other times the only way to reach the isle is to swim or sail. The PCs can use the rowboat found at @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02fisherspoint00] to reach the isle. Once the villagers know what’s at stake, the PCs can ask one of the local fishers to transport them out on one of their boats, but in that case the rowboat won’t be available for a quick getaway—the PCs will need to arrange a schedule or signal to let the fishers know they need to be picked up. </p> <p> Most of the isle’s shoreline is made up of sheer, 50-foot-high cliffs, but the eastern shore slopes more gently down to the ocean. It’s a short hike up through dry grass and stunted trees to the isle’s center where the ruins of Rusthenge itself await. Once a place of harnessing sinful soul energy by sacrificing envious creatures in the center pit, Rusthenge has lain dormant for thousands of years. Originally, the spires themselves rose hundreds of feet into the air, and the place was known as the Vloric Spires. </p> <p>As the PCs approach, read the following.</p> <div class=\"read-aloud\"> <p> At the isle’s crown is a broad, flat field, its southern edge dropping away to the waves below, affording a magnificent view of the sea, while to the north, a craggy ridge of barren rock blocks the view of Iron Harbor. In a circle just north of the cliff’s edge rise seven jagged spires of rusted metal, each reaching over fifty feet into the sky. Within this circle of ancient iron stand seven rock formations that may have at one time been sculptures but now are little more than weathered chunks of stone and piles of rubble. At the center, a seven-sided pit drops a few feet into a heap of boulders, stones, and other scree, among which stubborn shoots of grass or small shrubs grow fitfully. </p> <p> A fifteen-foot-by-twenty-foot canvas tent has been erected between two of the metal spires on the western side. Nearby is a sizable wooden crate, its east side open to reveal an interior strewn with red-stained straw. Freshly dug channels through the thin soil connect two of the smaller stone sculptures and the pit at the center—these channels appear to have been soaked in blood. </p> </div> <p> The seven ruined rock formations within the ring of iron spires were once sculptures of the seven runes of sin used by Thassilonian wizards—a PC who spends a few minutes examining the site can recognize these shapes with a successful @Check[arcana|dc:20] or an appropriate Lore check, like @Check[xin-edasseril-lore|dc:20]. </p> <p> Ever since the cultists of Xar-Azmak returned to the site, they’ve been conducting experiments in attempts to restart the old magic once capable of harvesting soul energies, hopeful this will help in the ritual Meitremar has been working on to resurrect the dead demon lord. Evidence of their attempts exists in a freshly dug channel between the central pit and two of the old rune sculptures, but also in the strange lights some folks have witnessed. </p> <p> A stairway down into the chambers below has remained hidden here for thousands of years, covered by a thick layer of soil and debris over the entrance and unguessed at by the locals. The first night the cultists visited the site (several days before the PCs’ arrival in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02ironharbor0000#iron-harborsettlement-2]), they uncovered this hidden stairwell and erected a tent over it, but before the PCs can explore this flight of spiral stairs, they’ll need to contend with the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03sacrificekee00] who stand vigil here. </p> <p> Finally, the Vloric Spires themselves exude a subtle, unsettling aura that tends to make those who step into the circle of spires feel unpleasant. As soon as a PC sets foot within the ring, they must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|dc:15] save to avoid becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18] (or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.MIRkyAjyBeXivMa7] for 24 hours on a critical failure).

He needn’t have worried, for when Belimarius discovered the truth, she increased her support, reasoning that it could only help her cause to have a grateful demon lord as an ally. </p> <p> When Theiltemar built the Vloric Spires, the above-ground structures were largely intended as a sort of magical “amplifier” for the potent magic he intended to harness to resurrect his patron, Xar-Azmak.

Connections to the Darklands below have allowed numerous creatures to filter up into the complex, including two factions whose temperaments made alliances easy—a small group of deros and a larger group of albino boggards. While Meitremar managed to secure something akin to an alliance with the deros, the boggards have been a bit more standoffish. Rather than waste resources trying to fight them, though, Meitremar’s ordered the cultists to simply ignore the boggards for now—once Xar-Azmak is raised, they’ll have plenty of time to “clean house.” </p> <p> These boggards, who refer to themselves as the Children of the Black Lake, are natives to the Darklands and have the pale countenances to match. Known to some as “deep boggards,” these creatures’ slightly phosphorescent pale green flesh gives them an almost ghostly look, but apart from this they’re quite similar to their surface-dwelling kin—though the Black Lake boggards have no idea that others like them dwell in the world above. The boggards have been idly looting the ruins below Rusthenge for weeks, bringing their choicest treasures to Gurga in the “dripping room” (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03drippingroom00]). When Meitremar and his cultists arrived, the boggards chose to barricade themselves and their treasures into this part of the complex.

Now the boggards are waiting for the humans to leave so they can return home. </p> <p> Only two boggards remain in this room. These two scouts, Bolgus and Durgon, spend their time sorting the items they’ve salvaged from the workshop and cleaning the grime from them. They’re paranoid about the invading humans them and act unfriendly toward any non-boggards who enter the room. A PC can convince the boggards they mean no harm with a successful @Check[diplomacy|dc:18|traits:action:make-an-impression|name:Make an Impression] check to Make an Impression. If the boggards are made indifferent, they call their boss, Gurga, to pass judgment. Once Gurga arrives from the dripping room (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03drippingroom00]), a PC must Make an Impression on her with a successful @Check[diplomacy|dc:20|traits:action:make-an-impression|name:Make an Impression] check to earn her trust. Failure to impress Gurga results in her ordering Bolgus and Durgon to attack the PCs, accusing them of being “lying liars who lie.” </p> <p> If the PCs do successfully impress the boggards and convince them not to attack, the boggards craft “friend badges” for each of the PCs. These badges are constructed from a chip of stone, glowing mushrooms, rodent teeth, and a sticky brown substance that might be mud. Visibly wearing the resulting “badge” can help prevent other Black Lake boggards from attacking them. They’ll also tell the PCs about the secret door in the storage room (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03magicalstora00]) that leads to a weird room (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03secretlab00000]) and the stairs that lead further down to the boggards’ home. </p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <div class=\"encounter-image-wrapper\"> <img style=\"transform: scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-rusthenge/assets/tokens/Boggard%20Scout.webp\"> </div> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Dining Hall</span> <span class=\"keepme\">Low 2</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.NWJvhxgboK7Kj0gw]</span> </div> <p> If the PCs can’t reach an accord, the boggards attack, but as they battle they make a fighting retreat toward area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03drippingroom00] to gain Gurga’s assistance.

A pair of massive columns of rusted metal loom in large alcoves to the east and south, each fitted with complex hinged armatures and drooping lengths of wire that connect them to one of two large metallic worktables. Gears grind slowly and glowing crystals periodically pulse from these worktables. A stone well ten feet in diameter stands in the center of the room between the two strange worktables, capped with a stone slab engraved with a singular broad rune with three downward spikes. Bookshelves line the northern wall, though most of their contents have fallen to ruin—save for one faded red tome near the center of the northern wall. </p> <p> In this laboratory, Theiltemar conducted his experiments on skymetal for Belimarius’s approval. A PC who’s visited the aboveground ruins of Rusthenge immediately recognizes the two rusted metal columns as being identical in shape—indeed, these long spires of rust are the roots of the surface ruin’s southeastern spires. The loops of wires and armatures connect the spires to the magical worktables, allowing spellcasters to adjust and direct the energies gathered by the spires for various purposes. A PC who examines the apparatuses here and succeeds at a @Check[arcana|dc:20|traits:concentrate,exploration,secret,action:identify-magic|name:Identify Magic] check to Identify Magic can tell that the spires are a sort of magical “battery,” and the workbenches are meant to help focus the energies; this success also allows the PC to deactivate a workbench as an Interact action. The workbenches have AC 18, Hardness 9, and 36 Hit Points (BT 18). </p> <p> The stone-capped well is one of several attempts by Belimarius’s agents to create a working <em>runewell</em> (a magical artifact capable of creating hidden demiplanes and storing vast amounts of magic) for the envious runelord, yet like all such attempts it never achieved this level of power. What the well does do is capture fleeting amounts of soul energy from creatures sacrificed at the center of the Vloric Spires above, then converts that energy into distilled envy. Theiltemar had many uses for this glowing liquid in his experiments, but when Earthfall struck, Theiltemar and his followers capped off the envy basin with a large stone slab, hoping to preserve the power within for later use and drastically underestimating the world-changing nature of the cataclysm. Of course, Theiltemar and his cultists never returned to this lab. </p> <p> While the stone slab was once much stronger, it has weakened after thousands of years of exposure to the lingering energies of Xar-Azmak’s faith. It has AC 15, Hardness 7, and 28 Hit Points (BT 14). If it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.6dNUvdb1dhToNDj3] condition, cracks in the stone become large enough to release the primordial envy sealed within (see Creatures). Alternatively, a PC who succeeds at a @Check[athletics|dc:20|traits:attack,skill,action:force-open|name:Force Open] check can Force Open the well by sliding the stone cap to the side. </p> <p> The faded red tome on the northern shelves is made of wood and bound with leather, as a real book might be. When this library was full, it was well hidden, but it’s now quite conspicuous. Pulling on the book activates a hidden lever that opens the secret door behind the bookcase.

The three agents attack the PCs on sight, but as soon as one is slain, one of the others panics and races over to a table to jerk aside one of the crystals as an Interact action.

The second fresco shows the figure underwater, walking among crumbling coral and battling a three-eyed fish-like creature with several long tentacles, his rusty armor forming an orange cloud in the water. The third fresco depicts the figure standing in a wheat field, decay and rot spreading from his rusty form as he battles an antler-headed man and a leaf-crowned woman, both covered in boils.

In the fifth fresco, he marches through an infernal city, toppling jagged towers by rusting their foundations and turning all he touches to ruin; a quad-horned devil cries out in anguish in the background. </p> <p> Finally, in the sixth fresco, a beam of red-brown light falls on a raised stone dais, surrounded by black robed figures in supplication.

His entries since arriving in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02ironharbor0000#iron-harborsettlement-2] are short and brief. One mentions his elation at recovering the <em>Horn of Rust</em> in the “grand temple.” This entry also mentions his discovery of a secret door behind the temple’s looming statue of Xar-Azmak.

Meitremar was just about to begin the long rite to resurrect Xar-Azmak at the time, and didn’t have much time to spare to deal with another prisoner. He chose to lock Ordwi in here, keeping her alive in case the rite went poorly and he needed an additional sacrifice. </p> <p> Ordwi’s condition depends on how long it took the PCs to reach this room; when she was placed here originally, she was unconscious at 1 Hit Point. She still wears her explorer’s clothing, but her other possessions were either fed to the Vlorian cythnigot (including her rapier and her metal religious symbol) or taken by Meitremar (any <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.2RuepCemJhrpKKao]</em> she still had when she was taken captive). Having little else to do now but recover via long-term rest, Ordwi heals 8 Hit Points per day. Without her religious symbol, though, she can’t cast any spells. Meitremar left her with a bucket of water and a few days’ worth of rations, but at your option, if the PCs take longer than a week to reach this room, she might have died of thirst—or at the very least be suffering from dehydration or starvation. </p> <p> Assuming she still lives, she’s overjoyed to see the PCs while simultaneously warning them about the people here, and that the leader of the cultists has been performing some awful ritual intended to bring a great evil into the world. The PCs likely know as much or more than Ordwi at this point, but feel free to have her fill in a few gaps in their knowledge as you see fit. In particular, she currently suspects all of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02ironharbor0000#iron-harborsettlement-2] to be in league with the cult—if the PCs can explain the situation to her, she’s much relieved (while still being worried about what Meitremar is up to). </p> <p> If the PCs can supply her with healing, gear, and a religious symbol of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.v67fHklTZ6LoU54q], she can join them on their adventures if you wish, but she would prefer to be escorted back out of the dungeon to the relative safety of Iron Harbor, where she can work with Elsie to further spread the word about what’s going on here. If the PCs weren’t able to supply her with a religious symbol, she’ll be able to make a serviceable one herself after a few hours in the village, at which point she offers her spellcasting support to the PCs for free. </p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Actor.zb2LebobKQWXeVQ1]</span><span>Creature 2</span></h2> <p>Female human cleric of Cayden Cailean</p> </section> <p><strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs rescue Ordwi and get her to safety, they earn 80 XP.</p>"

The PCs can gain up to 6 Disruption Points from these locations, but even if all are disrupted, Meitremar’s progress on the ritual continues. </p> <p> Once the <em>wall of force</em> comes down, the sound of the ritual becomes apparent as the four cultists chant prayers of adulation to Xar-Azmak. Each time Meitremar blows the <em>Horn of Rust</em>, a low rumbling sound, like old metal grinding against stone, fills the room.

Still loyal to the legacy of the long-dead demon lord, the vloriak assists Meitremar in combat. Worse, the pulsing energies emanating from the portal animate the dead cultist as a variant plague zombie whose attacks inflict rust creep rather than zombie rot. This fight—against a vloriak, Meitremar, three Rustsworn cultists, and a plague zombie—is beyond an Extreme 3 encounter.

When the PCs attack, Meitremar speaks his command word and calls in the vloriak, but with the portal being unstable, it saps some of the demon’s power and it gains the weak creature adjustment (see <em>Pathfinder Bestiary</em> page 6).

He sacrifices all three of the remaining cultists, which is enough to get the ritual started again, but there’s simply not enough power. When the PCs attack, Meitremar panics and attempts to summon the vloriak. The vloriak appears in its weakened state, but is not particularly happy about the situation. It shrieks in rage, then turns to Meitremar and says, “Who are you to think yourself worthy of a dead demon’s notice? Nothing but a stain, mortal!” At the same time, all four dead cultists rise as zombie shamblers. While the zombies move to attack the PCs, the vloriak Spews Rusted Shards at Meitremar (in such a way that it doesn’t catch any PCs) and then attempts a claw Strike against Meitremar. </p> <p> If Meitremar’s turn takes place before the demon, he spends his turn first in an attempt to Demoralize the demon (requiring a @Check[intimidation|dc:23|traits:auditory,concentrate,emotion,fear,mental,action:demoralize|name:Demoralize] check), and then activates the <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06405advent.JournalEntryPage.05thehornofrus00]</em>. </p> <p> If his turn takes place after the demon attacks him, Meitremar realizes his error and shrieks in terror—he becomes frightened 1 and spends his first action to Stride as far from the demon as he can before activating the <em>Horn of Rust</em>. All of this strains the magic enough that, at the end of the round, the vloriak is forced back to the Abyss, screaming in frustration as it goes. The remainder of the combat consists of the PCs facing the zombies and the likely wounded Meitremar, whose fury at their meddling compels him to fight to the death. This fight against Meitremar and four zombies is a Moderate 3 encounter. If you wish to have an extra layer of drama, you can have Meitremar immediately rise as a plague zombie capable of inflicting rust creep once he’s slain, as the lingering Abyssal energies infuse his remains with sinister power. </p> </section> <p> <strong>Tactical Retreat:</strong> If the PCs realize they’re in over their heads in this fight and flee, the foes they faced do not pursue them, but instead get back to the task of completing the ritual. If the vloriak demon is still present, it returns to the Abyss soon after the PCs flee. The amount of time Meitremar needs to complete the ritual is flexible, but at the very least you should give the PCs a day to head back into the upper works to disrupt things a bit more before they try again. If you determine that the PCs have taken too long (perhaps after a third failed attempt), see Concluding the Adventure below for the ramifications of Meitremar’s completed ritual. </p> <p> <strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.2c8g1noVjApqAtia]<br /> In addition to the gear carried by the cultists and Meitremar himself, the fate of the <em>Horn of Rust</em> now falls to the PCs.

But as long as the <em>Horn of Rust</em> continues to exist, the potential for other cultists of the Sin of Steel to begin the ritual themselves remains. Even in its dormant state, the <em>Horn of Rust</em> is still an artifact, and destroying it is no easy task. The PCs may decide to keep the <em>Horn of Rust</em> for themselves to protect it from falling into enemy hands, although the horn does bring suffering to those who carry it. If the PCs seek the advice of the elders of Osprey Cove, they suggest traveling south to the city of Magnimar to seek advice from the city’s scholars. They’ll agree to hide the <em>Horn of Rust</em> and watch over it if the PCs wish. In any event, you can use the artifact and the quest for its destruction to further expand upon the party’s next set of adventures! </p> <p> The questions of what to do about the <em>Swordfish</em> and Xin-Edasseril remain as well. Fortunately for the Kindred Coast, Meitremar’s secrecy about his mission and the fact that he was a very low-ranking member of New Thassilon’s elite means that there will be no investigations into his disappearance anytime soon. But it’s still only a matter of time before Runelord Belimarius becomes more interested in the Kindred Coast. Having the PCs aid the local community in building up the area’s defenses and perhaps exploring further inland on Chakikoth Isle to prepare for this inevitable development can also serve as the foundation of an exciting campaign. </p> <p> Iron Harbor—and more to the point, the temple of Stonehome—are greatly weakened by the events of this adventure, but it’s likely that the PCs’ actions left a favorable impression on the citizens. This is just the series of events the two villages of the Kindred Coast needed to take their first steps toward reconciliation. As for Osprey Cove, this incident has left quite a few worried about Xin-Edasseril’s future involvement in their affairs. Some locals think it’s best to move, while others don’t want to abandon their homes and wish to stay behind. The PCs themselves are in a perfect position to guide both villages’ futures. </p> <p> Of course, the troubles and toils of mortals do not worry the Sin of Steel, whose remains yet linger in the Rift of Repose. As long as the <em>Horn of Rust</em> exists, so does the possibility of Xar-Azmak’s resurrection. For now, the faint consciousness of the demon lord waits. Years and decades are important to mortals, but a dead demon lord can wait an eternity. </p>"

From his first quasi-success, Meitremar kindles the spark of consciousness that lingers in Xar-Azmak’s remains, and in the months and years to come, his cult spreads through New Thassilon. Oracles, witches, and divine-casting sorcerers make up a significant part of this cult, but until the demon lord rises, no clerics join these ranks. </p> <p> If the PCs survive, they can attempt additional forays into the dungeon to defeat Meitremar, this time facing challenges appropriate for 4th-level characters. If the situation isn’t handled soon, though, Meitremar’s demon-enhanced forces take control over the whole Kindred Coast. This in turn swiftly draws the attention of Runelord Belimarius, who encourages the growth of the cult in return for their allegiance to her cause. Such a development would surely mean the end of the Kindred Coast as it has existed for decades—unless a new group of heroes can save the day! </p>"

They laid waste to an entire district, leaving it to languish in irrecoverable rusted decay. The archdevil Dispater was hard pressed against this assault on his home, and during the battle, one powerful swing of his mace snapped off one of the horns from Xar-Azmak’s skull. As the fiendish lords continued to battle, Xar-Azmak’s horn tumbled onto the battlefield, where it was left to absorb the fury and carnage that resulted from two fiendish demigods battling to the death in Hell. </p> <p> When Dispater dealt the killing blow to Xar-Azmak, crushing the Sin of Steel’s rusted armor into scrap, one of the lesser generals in Xar-Azmak’s army—a powerful @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06405advent.JournalEntryPage.05demonvloriak00]—escaped with the horn, hoping to find a way to use it to resurrect his leader.

This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims.</p><p>A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal.</p><p>The name \"void zombie\" is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included \"void dead,\" \"akata spawn,\" or \"bloodwalker,\" but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed.</p><p>The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two- after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of this strange behavior.</p>",

As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw's oversized claws are powerful weapons with their vicelike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey.</p><p>While reefclaws can't speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value-reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous-they've been known to tip over small flshing boats and attack those who fall overboard.</p><p>Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring.</p><p>Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most civilized people who know of reefclaws' intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fisherfolk whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures-or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.</p>",

Yeth hounds resemble lean, sleek dogs with overlarge ears and narrow paws that can tread on air as easily as the ground. Despite their canine appearance, yeth hounds are remarkably intelligent, although they rarely display this intelligence except when devising intricate tactics to ensnare their quarry. Their eerie bays echo across the countryside when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from the hounds' previous meals.</p><p>Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight, working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when then can't simply overpower and kill them.</p><p>Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound servants by fiendish patrons. Such hounds often serve as spies and are quick to turn against those who fail to advance the patrons' wicked aims. The cult of Lamashtu, in particular, is fond of using yeth hounds as temple guardians.</p>",

His entries since arriving in Iron Harbor are short and brief.

Once they have been judged, their soul is sent on to their final reward or punishment in the afterlife, and in the process is transformed into a creature known as a petitioner. This process grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is the result of the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which it is sent. The petitioner's memories from their life are typically wiped nearly clean, allowing them to retain only a few hazy fragments akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the petitioner's size, power, or nature in life, they're a Medium creature in their afterlife.</p><p>Existence as a petitioner can last for eons, but this state is not necessarily eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the outer planes themselves can further change the petitioner's nature by transforming them into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that is then used to expand a plane's physical manifestation, or by transforming the petitioner into a new form of supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or fiend. Should a petitioner die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their nature reverting back to the quintessence or elements that make up their plane. This represents the true end of a soul's journey: their associated life essence travels back to the heart of the Great Beyond to be recycled into the Positive Energy plane, fueling the creation of entirely new souls.</p><p>The larvae appear as maggot-like grubs with the face the petitioners had in life.</p>",
