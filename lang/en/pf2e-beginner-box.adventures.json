The Pathfinder Beginner Box contains everything you need to learn how to play the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, including rules to create your own fantasy hero and tools to make your own amazing stories.</p><p>Welcome to the Pathfinder Beginner Box! This module has been constructed from the ground up to provide you with a simple but detailed introduction to the Pathfinder Second Edition game system, as well as how to make the most out of its features in Foundry Virtual Tabletop. As you progress through the Menace Under Otari adventure, the Journal Entries you read will provide you with instructions on everything from game rules to software usage.</p><h2>Where to start?</h2><p>Most of the contents of this module are heavily interlinked, which means that you don't need to worry too much about reading something out of order. If something is relevant, we'll try to link to it, so you should always only be a click away from context at any point. However, it can be daunting to just dive in, so here are some recommended starting points!</p><ul><li><p>If you're new to Foundry, then some of the tabs on the left hand side will explain how to use the various types of content included in this adventure.</p></li><li><p>If you'd like to learn more about the rules of the Pathfinder Second Edition system, then the @UUID[JournalEntry.OoPjlnYYGLn5KPZy.JournalEntryPage.pgOC3zCWvUFGiuTj] journal exists to walk you through the key concepts and ideas.</p></li><li><p>If you'd like to dive right in to the Menace Under Otari adventure, then all you need to do is gather up some players and consult the @UUID[JournalEntry.qFSLpCM2cpRQWCR2.JournalEntryPage.UP1WB6tI0SFgMMzC] to see how to get started.

The folders in each tab have been color-coded to indicate who can see their contents. If the folder has a red hue it is visible to all players. If the folder has no color assigned, it contains reference material only (such as credits or legal information). If the folder is green, it contains information that is visible to GMs only.</p>"

They can be played individually, but clicking play on the playlist activates all three simultaneously, providing a soundscape with a faint bass drone of being underground, periodic wet drips to indicate a seaside cavern structure, and the sounds of rodents chittering and scratching.</li><li><strong>Floor 1 Exploration Ambience</strong> - This playlist only contains a single audio file, a looping string of dramatic piano notes to add some musical themes of sneaky exploration. It is best used in conjunction with other ambience playlists.</li><li><strong>Floor 2 Exploration Ambience</strong> - This playlist only contains a single audio file, a looping drone meant to convey the feeling of exploring a cavern deeper underground. It is best used in conjunction with other ambience playlists.</li><li><strong>Floor 2 Mermaid Fountain</strong> - a faint ominous drone and amplified sounds of running water which, when coupled with the on-scene Ambient sounds of water running should provide a clear audio cue to players that something might be wrong and dangerous with the fountain.</li><li><strong>Floor 2 Soggy Crossroads</strong> - This playlist should be used when players breach the barricade shortly after entering the second floor, as they near the water. It mixes the faint exploration piano from the first floor with heavy sounds of running water.</li><li><strong>Otari Fishery </strong>- The goal of this track is to convey the sounds of a busy and bustling establishment, with drink and games served and the sounds of workers. It should be used when the players speak with Tamily.</li><li><strong>Otari Wharf</strong> - A mix of sea birds and ocean waves to draw the players imagination to the sounds of a seaside town.</li><li><strong>Soundboard Loops</strong> - This is a soundboard containing looping tracks which can be drawn upon to evoke particular sound effects. For example, during the encounter with the Cinder Rat you may wish to play the \"Everything is Fire\" track until the rat is defeated, or when your players breach the first barricade to explore northward, you may wish to begin playing \"The Malevolent Dead\".</li></ul><p><strong>Sound Effects</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Barricades </strong>- these are the sound effect tracks which occur when players are removing the barricades, and can be replayed from here if the players miss out on hearing them.</li><li><strong>Dragon Soundboard</strong> - Intended for use while players move into the Mushroom Grotto, these effects allow you to indicate the presence of a dragon and then, as combat begins, the sounds of the dragon attacking or being injured.</li><li><strong>The Cinder Rat</strong> - The sound effect which plays when the Cinder Rat explodes out of the orb in @UUID[JournalEntry.qFSLpCM2cpRQWCR2.JournalEntryPage.7Ko4GJeI1K3Vy1Xp]</li></ul></article></section>"

If the area includes combat, traps, hazards, or treasure, the rules for those are in this text.</p><p>As they move through the dungeon levels, the players will use their heroes’ skills and abilities to explore the area and overcome its obstacles. It’s likely they’ll have questions and try actions that aren’t covered by the rules. As the GM, you get to make up the answers and decide what happens, but always try to be fair, and remember that the goal of the game is for everyone to have a fun time. You should encourage the heroes to try new things as they learn, but don’t forget that, as new adventurers, their heroes’ abilities are limited.</p><p>If the players get stuck or confused about what to do next, you can give them a few hints or ideas to get them started, like “Do you want to open the door?” or “Who wants to look for hidden treasure?” Remember that this is their first game, too, and they will have more fun if everyone is participating.</p>"

You decide how those people and monsters act, what they do in combat, and what intriguing clues they might give to the heroes. You’ll also describe each area the heroes explore so the other players can imagine the setting and decide how their heroes respond to what’s going on around them. These are the tools you use to help shape the story with the other players.</p><p>It’s important to remember that you’re not playing against the other players. This is a game where everyone wins if everyone has a fun time. Monsters are meant to be defeated, and treasure is there to be found.

                            "text": "<p>Before you can run a game, you need to prepare the adventure your group will play through. An adventure is a self-contained collection of story elements, characters, and settings that become the basis for the story you and the other players tell. Think of the adventure as an outline for your story. You’ll have major plot points you want to include, some consistent characters, and themes you want to convey, but all sorts of things can change during the process of turning the outline into a completed story!</p><aside class=\"bb-float-block\"><h2>Common Terms</h2><p>The following terms are used to describe certain common game elements.</p><p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A challenge is one short scene that puts the heroes to the test. This could be anything from fighting a monster to chasing a thief or getting past a deadly trap.</p><p><strong>Encounter:</strong> An encounter is a combat that plays out in a series of rounds with creatures taking actions in turn.</p><p><strong>Exploration:</strong> Between encounters, heroes are exploring. Usually, this means exploring an environment, but they might explore a social situation, a puzzle, or something else.</p><p><strong>Session:</strong> A session is a single period of gaming, ranging from about 2 hours up to an entire weekend. In a session, you might complete a whole adventure or just part of one.</p><p><strong>Adventure:</strong> An adventure is one story that the heroes experience. It’s made up of a series of explorations broken up by a series of encounters. Adventures might take one or more sessions to complete.</p><p><strong>Campaign:</strong> Campaign is a term used to describe all of the adventures that the heroes experience. The adventures might relate to one another, but not all of the adventures have to be tied into the same overarching plot.</p></aside><h2>Types of Adventures</h2><p>Adventures can be structured in different ways. A linear adventure has a set path with one encounter leading to another. A nonlinear adventure involves creating an environment with multiple paths the heroes can explore in any order. Finally, a sandbox adventure takes place over a wide environment with the players setting their own goals. For your first adventures, start simple with either a fully linear adventure or one with only a small number of optional paths.</p><h3>Prewritten Adventures</h3><p>The @UUID[JournalEntry.qFSLpCM2cpRQWCR2] adventure has much of the preparation done for you. Reading the adventure and looking over the materials in the Beginner Box gives you enough preparation to run that adventure. “Menace Under Otari” and other prewritten adventures are built for groups of a specific level. They include setup information and nonplayer characters (NPCs) needed for the story, plus all the locations, maps, and monster groups; they also give out the appropriate amount of XP and treasure. Running one as your first game can help you see how adventures are structured, which makes it easier to write your own later if you choose. Though a published adventure is prewritten, its events aren’t set in stone. Changing the details of an adventure to suit your group isn’t just OK, it’s preferred! Adjust things to make the adventure appeal to your players more, and add to the adventure in ways that will make your players happy.</p><h3>Writing an Adventure</h3><p>When writing your own adventures, you’ll need to prepare further by picking monsters, drawing maps, and coming up with NPCs that live in the world. This takes more time on your part but also lets you customize your game to your group. If you're interesting, turn to @UUID[.UyPEle3d3z9ncJzy] for guidance on creating original adventures!</p>"

You can continue with the same group and heroes in an ongoing campaign. A campaign is a connected series of adventures. You can build new adventures based on what has happened so far, or adapt prewritten adventures.</p><p>Campaigns work better if you carry forward some NPCs, themes, and villains from adventure to adventure. For example, after <em>Menace under Otari</em>, you can use the @UUID[Scene.c7E7PXzgT5RBkT7S] section to get some ideas for what you might include in your next adventure. You can also get more adventures for your campaign with the Pathfinder Adventures book Troubles in Otari or the three-book Adventure Path Abomination Vaults.</p><h2>The Story</h2><p>When you decide to build an adventure, first come up with a basic plot or theme for it. Think of this step like casting a play rather than writing out every scene. You’re picking enemies and places where cool things can take place, but only by improvising with the other players during play will you find out what happens!</p><p>Adventure plotting can start at many different points. You might begin with a particular antagonist, then construct an adventure that fits that villain’s theme and leads the group to them. Alternatively, you could start with an interesting location for exploration, then populate it with adversaries and challenges appropriate to the setting.</p><p>If you’re stuck for ideas, roll [[/r 1d8]] and look up the result on the table below!

Each session can noticeably differ from the last. Think of a session as an episode of a TV show— it should include some twists, turns, and changes so that the players are excited about what comes next.</p><section class=\"character-creation\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Planning a Session</h3><p>Often, the responsibility of scheduling the game falls on you as the GM since you have to prepare the game between sessions. Choose a time everyone can attend and a place to gather, whether it's around the kitchen table or in an online space. Many games have a set schedule, such as once per week, once every 2 weeks, or once per month. (Your first game might not be so predictable, though!) The less frequently your group meets, the better notes and recaps you'll need to keep everyone on the same page. If another player wants to take session notes, that's great too, especially if they set up a shared document everyone can reference online.</p><p>Plan a time for everybody to arrive, and also try to set a time when playing the game will begin. Having this planned can make it easier for everyone to finish catching up so you can start playing the game. Having an end time in mind is also important. A typical game session lasts about 4 hours. Less than 2 hours usually isn't enough time to get much done.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Starting a Session</h3><p>Once everyone is ready to play, get everyone's attention and cover the following topics. These are in a rough order that you can change based on your group's style or a session's needs.</p><p>• Recap what happened during the previous sessions (if this isn't the first session).</p><p>• Establish where the heroes are at the beginning of this session. Have they been resting since their last challenge? Did you leave off with them in a hallway, preparing to raid the next room of a dungeon? Tell players whether their heroes had time to rest or recover since the last session.</p><p>• Establish goals. Repeat any goals the group already had, then let the players weigh in on whether these goals still apply and on whether there's anything else they hope to accomplish during the session.</p><p>• Commence adventuring! Usually the first thing you'll do in a session is describe the environment and sensations that surround the heroes, allowing them to react in the moment.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Running a Session</h3><p>During a session, you're in charge of keeping the game's action moving, answering questions, and making rules decisions. You'll also want to keep a rough eye on the time, so you can end when it's most convenient for the group.</p><p>You're the one who customizes the rules you need from the imagined world you and the other players share. It's up to you to establish what's true in the world, but you have help in doing so! You're informed by the setting's backstory, your preparations, and the suggestions the other players make. You can adjust things on the fly from what you planned, too. You might have an idea in your notes that changes when a player does something unexpected.</p><p>You'll determine when heroes and foes need to attempt checks as well as what happens as a result of their rolls, which comes up most often during exploration. In an encounter, a player can usually determine their own hero's turn with you chiming in only to say whether an attack hits or if something in the environment requires a hero to attempt a check.</p><h3>The Spotlight</h3><p>As you run the game, keep track of which player has the spotlight. You can easily keep attention on the most outgoing player or hero, but you need to check in with all the players. If a player hasn't contributed in some time, stop and ask, \"What's your hero doing at this point?\" If the player isn't sure, add a detail or NPC to the scene that the player might find interesting.</p><h3>Distractions and Interruptions</h3><p>Maintaining the players' attention keeps a game moving and leads to memorable moments when everyone's in the zone. Too many interruptions break the flow. Some distractions will always happen, like jokes at the table, but make sure interruptions aren't too frequent. It helps to plan breaks into the game. A 10-minute break is a great time to grab a snack, use the restroom, or look up something on your phone.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Ending a Session</h3><p>It's best to have a planned end time before your session starts. As your game goes on, keep an eye on the time. When you have around 20 minutes left in your session, start looking for good stopping places. Unless you're finishing up an adventure, try to find a good cliffhanger to end on. This can be just before a fight starts, the moment the heroes find out a new piece of information or enter a new area, or any other point that creates suspense!</p><p>Before everybody leaves, have them tally up their XP. They'll need to level up before the next session if it's over 1,000! The characters can also divide treasure and items.</p><p>Before your next session, you might need to prepare for the next stage of the adventure. If the adventure concluded this session, talk with the players about whether they want to start a new adventure. If so, start preparing the next adventure for your upcoming session!</p></article></section>"

Here are guidelines for the most common tasks, with Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation grouped together under “Social Skills.” Anything more difficult than what’s listed here uses the <strong>Master</strong> DC of 30. Remember that all of these are guidelines, and you can adjust them as necessary to suit the situation.</p><hr /><h3>Balance (Acrobatics)</h3><p>Use @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs] based on what the character is trying to balance across.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) tangled roots, uneven cobblestones</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) wooden beam</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) deep, loose gravel</p><hr /><h3>Climb (Athletics)</h3><p>Use @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs] based on what the character is trying to climb up or across.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) ladder, low-branched tree, steep slope</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) rigging, rope, typical tree</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) wall with small handholds and footholds</p><hr /><h3>Decipher Writing</h3><p>Base the DC on how complex and hard to understand the text is. A hero doesn’t need to roll to read a text that’s written in plain language.</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) entry-level philosophy treatise</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) complex code, such as a cipher</p><hr /><h3>Gather Information (Diplomacy)</h3><p>To set the DC to Gather Information, use a @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs] representing the availability of information about the subject. Adjust the DC upward if the hero seeks in-depth information.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) talk of the town</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) common rumor</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) obscure rumor, poorly guarded secret</p><hr /><h3>Identify Magic or Learn a Spell</h3><p>The DC to Identify Magic or Learn a Spell is the @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-5:-level-based-dcs] for the spell or item’s level.</p><hr /><h3>Perform (Performance)</h3><p>Consider the audience’s exposure to the arts when picking the @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]. How easy are they to impress?</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) audience of commoners</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) audience of artisans</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) audience of merchants or minor nobles</p><hr /><h3>Recall Knowledge</h3><p>On most topics, you can use simple DCs for checks to Recall Knowledge. For a check about a specific creature, trap, or other subject with a level, use a @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-5:-level-based-dcs]. You might adjust the difficulty down, maybe even drastically if the subject is famous.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) name of a ruler, key noble, or major deity</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) line of succession for a major noble family, core doctrines of a major deity</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) genealogy of a minor noble, teachings of an ancient priest</p><p>Sometimes a hero might want to follow up on a check to Recall Knowledge by attempting another check to discover more information. This can sometimes work, but you should adjust the difficulty to be higher for each follow-up attempt. Once a hero has attempted an incredibly hard check or failed a check, further attempts are fruitless—the hero has recalled everything they know about the subject.</p><p>Information on using Recall Knowledge to identify monsters is in the @UUID[.ZVyi2AkmgpWOHvSq] handout.</p><hr /><h3>Sense Direction (Survival)</h3><p>Pick the most appropriate @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs] when someone uses Survival to Sense Direction.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) determine a cardinal direction using the sun</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) find an overgrown path in a forest</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) navigate a hedge maze</p><hr /><h3>Social Skills</h3><p>When a hero uses Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation to influence or impress someone whose level or Will DC you don’t know, estimate the level of the creature and use that DC. A commoner’s level is usually 0 or 1. Don’t worry about being exact. It often makes sense to adjust the DC based on the target’s attitude, using one of the easy DC adjustments if the creature is more friendly or a hard DC adjustment if they dislike the hero. Remember that NPCs aren’t robots. If they’d be unlikely to do something, you can make the DC harder or even impossible!</p><hr /><h3>Swim (Athletics)</h3><p>Use @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs] based on how turbulent the water is.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) lake or other still water</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) flowing water, like a river</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) swiftly flowing river</p><hr /><h3>Track (Survival)</h3><p>Pick a @UUID[.7ki36LtGrCjGHugy#table-10-4:-simple-dcs]. You can adjust the DC to Track based on weather, terrain, and other factors.</p><p>• <strong>Untrained</strong>: (DC 10) the path of a large army following a road</p><p>• <strong>Trained</strong>: (DC 15) relatively fresh tracks of a rampaging bear across the tundra</p><p>• <strong>Expert</strong>: (DC 20) a nimble panther’s tracks through a jungle, tracks obscured by rainfall</p>"

They often feature combat with other creatures, but they can also include @UUID[.f82BLxCvoOGIzQ7U], or you might create social challenges in which characters duel only with words. The rules for building challenges appropriate to your group’s level, as well as how to run them, are contained within this journal.</p><p>Some adventures have a clear and direct progression, with challenges occurring at specific times or in a specific order. Others, such as a dungeon filled with interconnected rooms the group can investigate in any order, are nonlinear, and the group can face challenges in any order—or even avoid them entirely. Most adventures are somewhere in between, with some keystone challenges you know the heroes must contend with and some optional ones that the heroes could avoid.</p><h2>Types of Encounter</h2><h3>Combat Encounters</h3><p>The most common type of challenge is a combat encounter, where the heroes fight other creatures. As you plan your adventure, think about the kinds of creatures that fit your story. Not all of them have to be important to the plot. It’s okay to include monsters you think would just be fun to use! Think about your players, too. Include monsters you think they’d like going up against based on the players’ personalities.</p><p>While you’re picking encounters for your adventure, make notes about which area each encounter appears in and details about the creatures involved. This includes notes on their place in the adventure’s plot and any treasure you want them to carry. You can look at the rooms in “Menace under Otari” for the types of information to include, though you can just use brief notes instead of writing everything out in detail.</p><h3>Social Interactions</h3><p>Some conversations and other social interactions are important enough that you should treat them with the same importance as encounters. If major consequences can come from the conversation, success or failure really matters. These interactions should be worth XP. It’s usually a moderate accomplishment, but it might be a major one for something like talking a king out of going to war!</p><p>Social interactions don’t follow the same rules as combat. Roleplay them as a conversation, and have the heroes roll skill checks as appropriate. These are usually Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation, but players might think of something clever, like using Religion to make friends with a local priest. Remember that you can give heroes circumstance bonuses (usually +1 or +2) if their approach is really likely to work on the person they’re talking to.</p>"

This will tell us our Encounter Budget. You can choose from the list below, or use Table 10-1 on the @UUID[.LhKbKh6JlJKFhwbO] handout.</p><p>• <strong>Low-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 60 XP) use some of the party’s resources, but they aren’t that scary. It would be unlikely (or the result of very poor tactics) for the entire party to be seriously threatened.</p><p>• <strong>Moderate-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 80 XP) are a serious challenge to the heroes, though unlikely to overpower them completely. Heroes usually need to use sound tactics and manage their resources wisely.</p><p>• <strong>Severe-threat encounters</strong> (budget = 120 XP) are the hardest encounters most groups of heroes can consistently defeat. These encounters should be save for important moments in your story, such as confronting a final boss. Bad luck, poor tactics, or lack of resources due to prior encounters can easily turn a severe-threat encounter against the heroes, and a wise group keeps the option to disengage open.</p><p>You might warn the players when they enter a severe fight, especially if they’re new to Pathfinder. Their heroes likely can tell when they’re up against an enemy that looks really tough, even if the players aren’t sure yet!</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Step 2: Spend Your Budget</h3><p>Next, we can use our budget to choose creatures and hazards to populate our encounter.

You can use your actions on your turn, and some special rules apply at the start and end of your turn. Here’s what you do during each part of your turn.</p><h2>Start of Your Turn</h2><p>• If you created an effect with a duration lasting a certain number of rounds, like many spells do, reduce the number of rounds remaining by 1. The effect ends if the duration is reduced to 0.</p><p>• If you’re dying, roll a recovery check (see @UUID[JournalEntry.OoPjlnYYGLn5KPZy.JournalEntryPage.SucJycHedcDPml60]).</p><p>• Lose the reaction from your previous turn, and regain your 3 actions and 1 reaction. You can’t “save up” unused actions or reactions from previous turns. If a condition or effect prevents you from using some, but not all, of your actions, you still regain the remaining actions. If a condition or effect prevents you from using all of your actions, you don’t regain any actions or your reaction.</p><h2>Using Actions</h2><p>• Now that you have your actions, it’s time to use them! You can perform your actions in any order you wish, but you have to complete one before beginning another. For example, you couldn’t Strike while in the middle of a Stride unless a special activity lets you. You can pick your actions from the basic actions available to all characters as well as any actions you get from your class, ancestry, equipment, or any other choices you made during character creation.</p><p>• Once you’re done spending actions, go to the end of your turn.</p><h2>End of Your Turn</h2><p>• Lose any of your 3 actions that remain. You keep your reaction if you didn’t use it on your turn; you lose it at the start of your next turn.</p><p>• If you are suffering from @UUID[JournalEntry.OoPjlnYYGLn5KPZy.JournalEntryPage.9H0Jrj0siUcpFC1s#persistent-damage], you take the damage at this time. After taking the damage, you can attempt the flat check to end the persistent damage.</p><p>• End any effects that last until the end of your turn.</p><p>• Resolve anything else specified to happen at the end of your turn.</p><p>• Your turn is over, and the next creature’s turn begins.</p>"

While they’re most often opponents in combat, creatures can provide interesting situations outside of encounters.</p><h2>Reading Creature Statistics</h2><p>Each creature’s statistics appear on their character sheet. You can find these in the Actors tab of your sidebar- here is the @UUID[Actor.r9w1n85mp9Ip4QiS] as an example.</p><p>These sheets include a lot of information about a creature, some of which is very similar to how player characters work. A few key points are:</p><ul><li><p>The top of a creature’s stat block lists its name and its level. While heroes start at 1st level, some weak creatures can be level 0 or even level -1.</p></li><li><p>Underneath the name is the creature’s traits line. All creatures will have a rarity, an alignment, and a size. The creature’s other traits are then listed alphabetically.</p></li><li><p>The stat block also lists all the actions and abilities the creature can use other than the basic actions available to every creature. Action icons note how many actions an ability requires.</p></li><li><p>Some creatures have spells or equipment, which are included in the other tabs of their character sheet.</p></li></ul><h3>Creature Size</h3><p>Creatures can be Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large. Medium creatures, like the heroes, take up one square on a grid, as do Small creatures. Up to four Tiny creatures can fit in one square, and a Tiny creature can share a square with a Small or larger creature. Large creatures take up a 2 × 2 area.</p><h2>Choosing Monster Actions</h2><p>As the GM, you roleplay monsters and choose their tactics. Players often coordinate and plan to be as efficient as possible, but monsters might not! Most creatures have a basic grasp of simple tactics like flanking or focusing on a single target. But remember that they also react based on emotions and make mistakes! Some creatures have only animal intelligence or are mindless, and you should play them that way.</p><p>Monsters usually don’t attack a hero who’s knocked out. Even if a creature knows a fallen hero might come back into the fight, only the most vicious creatures focus on helpless foes rather than the more immediate threats around them.</p><h2>Identifying Creatures</h2><p>The Recall Knowledge action can be used to identify a creature. The DC is based on the creature’s level.</p><p>The skill used depends on that creature’s most important trait, as shown below. A hero who identifies a creature learns one of its abilities—such as a troll’s regeneration. On a critical success, the hero also learns a second detail that’s less commonly known, like the trigger for the creature’s reaction.</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>Creature Trait</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th><th><p>Skill to Identify</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Aberration</p></td><td><div><p>Strange corruptions of the natural order</p></div></td><td><p>Occultism</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Animal</p></td><td><div><p>Mundane animals with low Intelligence</p></div></td><td><p>Nature</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Beast</p></td><td><div><p>Creatures similar to animals but more intelligent</p></div></td><td><p>Nature, Arcana</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Construct</p></td><td><div><p>Artificial creatures, neither living nor undead</p></div></td><td><p>Crafting, Arcana</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dragon</p></td><td><div><p>Reptilian creatures, often with wings and a breath weapon</p></div></td><td><p>Arcana</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Elemental</p></td><td><div><p>Creatures directly tied to air, earth, fire or water</p></div></td><td><p>Arcana, Nature</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fey</p></td><td><div><p>Creatures of the First World</p></div></td><td><p>Nature</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Humanoid</p></td><td><div><p>Intelligent creatures, typically bipedal with two arms</p></div></td><td><p>Society</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ooze</p></td><td><div><p>Creatures with simple, usually malleable anatomies</p></div></td><td><p>Occultism</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Undead</p></td><td><div><p>Creatures infused after death with soul-corrupting evil magic</p></div></td><td><p>Religion</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"

To learn more about how to use hazards in your game, keep reading!</p><h2>Running Hazards</h2><h3>Detecting a Hazard</h3><p>Every hazard has a trigger of some kind, like a trip wire or a pressure plate. When characters approach a hazard, they have a chance of finding the mechanism before triggering the hazard. During exploration, determine whether the party detects a hazard when the heroes first enter the area in which it appears. Only someone actively searching (using the Search activity while exploring or the Seek action in an encounter) has a chance to notice them. Anyone who succeeds becomes aware of the hazard, and you can describe what they notice.</p><h3>Triggering a Hazard</h3><p>If the group fails to detect a hazard and the hazard’s trigger depends on a standard part of traveling (such as stepping on a floor plate), the hazard’s reaction occurs. Hazards that would be triggered only when someone directly manipulates the environment—by opening a door, for example—use their reactions only if a hero explicitly takes that action.</p><h3>Disabling a Hazard</h3><p>The most versatile method for deactivating traps is the Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill. The DC is listed in the hazard’s stat block. As noted in skills, a creature must be trained in Thievery to use the Disable a Device action. Fully disarming some traps requires multiple successful Disable a Device actions. For example, disabling scythe blades requires a successful check on each of two blades. A critical failure on any roll to disable a hazard triggers it.</p><p>A character must first detect a hazard (or have it pointed out to them) to try to deactivate it. They can attempt to deactivate a hazard whether or not it has already been triggered, though most hazards no longer pose a danger once their reactions have occurred.</p><h3>Damaging a Hazard</h3><p>Damaging a trap works like damaging a shield: the trap reduces the damage it takes by its Hardness. If a hazard’s Hit Points are reduced to its Broken Threshold (BT) or lower, the hazard becomes broken and can no longer be activated. If it’s reduced to 0 HP, it’s destroyed and can’t be repaired. Usually, the trap is triggered when attacked, though it isn’t triggered if it’s destroyed in one hit because there’s not enough left to harm anyone! If it’s broken in one hit but not destroyed, you decide whether it triggers based on the type of trap.</p><p>Hazards’ AC, saving throws, Hardness, HP, and BT are listed in their stat blocks. A hazard that doesn’t list one of these statistics can’t be affected by anything targeting that statistic. For example, a hazard that has HP but no BT can’t be broken, but it can still be destroyed. Hazards can be targeted only by things that specifically say they can target objects. Certain abilities like bleed damage, poison, mental effects, and the sickened condition don’t work against a hazard, nor do any other effects that wouldn’t reasonably work on an object.</p><h2>Hazard Experience</h2><p>Characters gain XP for overcoming a hazard, whether they disable it, avoid it, or simply endure its attacks. If they trigger the same hazard later on, they don’t gain XP for the hazard again. The XP a hazard gives depends on the party’s level, as shown below. For example, a 0-level hazard faced by a 1st-level party is worth 6 XP because level 0 is the party’s level -1.</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>Level</p></th><th><p>Simple Hazard</p></th><th><p>Complex Hazard</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level -4</p></td><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level -3</p></td><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level -2</p></td><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level -1</p></td><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level</p></td><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>40</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level +1</p></td><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>60</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level +2</p></td><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>80</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level +3</p></td><td><p>24</p></td><td><p>120</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Party Level +4</p></td><td><p>30</p></td><td><p>150</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"

Your hero might be traveling from one town to another, chatting with a couple of merchants at an outpost along the way, or having a terse conversation with the watchful city guards at your destination.

Time is more flexible during exploration than in encounters and is measured in 10-minute intervals or more. You tell the players what happens, and you can skip over any parts of their travels that aren’t interesting!</p><h3>Set a Party Order</h3><p>When the group starts exploring, let the players decide among themselves where in the group their heroes are while exploring. This order can determine who gets attacked first when enemies or traps threaten from various directions. It’s up to you to determine the specifics of who gets targeted based on the situation.</p><p>When an encounter starts, the group usually remains in the same general formation. With the heroes' input, decide their positions when you put the tokens on the scene. If they get the drop on their enemies or detect a hazard in advance, they can move around as they see fit before dealing with it.</p><h2>Exploration Activities</h2><p>While the party explores, each player who wants to do something beyond just traveling chooses an exploration activity for their character. Players usually choose from the default activities, but there’s no need for them to memorize the exploration activities and use them exactly. Instead, when your players want to do something in addition to simply traveling, have them describe the basics of what they're attempting to do, such as “I’m searching for hazards” or “I’m keeping my shield ready in case we’re attacked.” As the GM, you find the best exploration activity to match their description and describe the effects of that activity. Some exploration activities limit how fast a character can travel and be effective:</p><p>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.IE2nThCmoyhQA0Jn]{Avoid Notice} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.cYtYKa1gDEl7y2N0]{Defend} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Yb0C1uLzeHrVLl7a]{Detect Magic} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JuqmIAnkL9hVGai8]{Hustle} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.EwgTZBWsc8qKaViP]{Investigate} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.kV3XM0YJeS2KCSOb]{Scout} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Search} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.fJImDBQfqfjKJOhk]{Sense Direction}</p><p>If a player wants to do something not on the list of exploration activities above, you can let them if they could reasonably do it while walking around. If the activity is similar to an action someone could use in an encounter, it usually consists of a single action repeated roughly 10 times per minute. You might find that a player wants to do something equivalent to spending 3 actions every 6 seconds (18 times per minute), just like they would in combat. However, heroes can’t maintain that level of exertion in exploration mode without getting exhausted. They can do so in combat only because combat lasts such a short time.</p><h3>Narrating Exploration</h3><p>As the group explores, describe the sights, sounds, and sensations. Encourage the other players to have their heroes truly explore, and reward their curiosity. The things they try to do in exploration mode show you what they’re interested in and what they consider important. As you play, you should get a good feel for what intrigues certain players, and you can add more of those things to your adventures or emphasize these points in published adventures.</p><p>Activities like Detect Magic, Investigate, and Search can tip off a player that something is odd about an area. But that doesn't mean they know exactly what it is! Instead, use these as a starting point for a roleplaying scene. For instance, if a character finds something magical with detect magic, the party likely still needs to stop and look at the surroundings in more detail to figure out what it is.</p><p>Similarly, if a character got a 22 on their Perception check to Search while traveling through an area containing a trap that needs a DC 20 to detect it, you should tell the player that their character noticed a trap in the area, and you can give a rough idea of the trap’s location and nature. The party needs to stop and examine the area more to learn specifics about the trap</p>"

Once you know your adventure's story, you can start drawing the map to make it easier to keep track of where everything is.

Then, when you run the game, you can use a map with a 1-inch grid (where every square inch represents a 5-foot square).</p><p>When you first draw your map, you should use a pencil so you can make changes easily. You can also jot down notes for each room as they come to you, like \"guard post\" or \"spider nest.\"</p><h3>Sample Map</h3><p>Here you can see the sketch used to make the first level of the \"Menace under Otari\" map!

A tunnel running off the edge of the map, a flight of stairs leading down, or a large pit can all lead the way to new areas.</p><p>• <strong>Avoid Symmetry</strong>: Refrain from creating symmetrical dungeons in which one half is an exact mirror image of the other— it's unrealistic, and the players might be disappointed when they realize that they only have to explore half of a dungeon to see it all.</p><p>• <strong>Vary Room Shapes</strong>: Instead of just a bunch of rectangles, include strangely shaped rooms, alcoves, multilevel rooms, irregular caverns, and other variations. You can look at maps of real-world locations to get some ideas.</p><p>• <strong>Use Wide Corridors</strong>: Remember that combat in Pathfinder is based on 5-foot squares. If you fill your dungeon with 5-foot-wide hallways, you might end up with combats in which some of the heroes or monsters can’t actually get into the fight!</p><p>• <strong>Don't Make a Maze</strong>: Avoid the temptation to make your map into a maze- exploring one gets old quick once you're playing, especially if you spend most of your time during the game drawing twisted corridors on your mat when you could be running combat!</p><h2>Finishing the Map</h2><p>Once you're happy with your map, inking in the pencil lines makes the map a lot easier to read. You can use a fat-tipped pen to draw solid walls. Thinner pens are great for drawing doors and map symbols. Adding color (whether with pens or colored pencils) makes your map even easier to read. Number each room so you can easily refer to it in your notes. If possible, use a pen of a different color from anything else on your map so the number tags are easy to see.</p><p>If you have a computer and scanner, you can scan your map and then use an image-editing program to refine it. This is handy if you make an error on the map with ink and need to fix things. Details such as furniture, fire pits, pillars, and so on add a touch of realism to inhabited dungeons, but you can also add these when you draw it on a battle grid if you feel comfortable doing so on the fly.</p><p>Once you've finished your map, you can upload it to your VTT of choice and add walls, lights, or tokens as you see fit. Even a hand-drawn map can work perfectly well in a digital environment- just be sure to supplement it with descriptions of the rooms to breathe some life into your creation! </p><h2>Strange Rooms</h2><p>If you’re having a hard time coming up with ideas for your map, you can take ideas from “Menace under Otari,” or use some of these classic ideas.</p><ul><li>Monster barracks full of filthy straw nests.</li><li><p>Narrow ledge overlooking a chasm.</p></li><li>Natural chimney in the rock that the heroes can climb up to reach a higher level.</li><li>Ancient library covered in dust.</li><li>Long hallway with rows of statues or suits of armor.</li><li>Sewer chamber blocked by gates on each side, with the levers to open them in another room.</li><li>Feasting hall with a large fire pit in the center.</li><li>Pens where guard animals are kept.</li><li>Museum with art made of permanent illusions.</li><li>Don't forget the latrines!</li></ul>"

For instance, a 10-foot current moves a creature 10 feet in the current’s direction at the end of that creature’s turn.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> choppy water, rolling waves, sunlight glinting, the curve of the horizon, driftwood</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> waves lapping against a ship, seabirds' cries, fluttering sails, creatures breaching the surface</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> salt water, crisp fresh air, dead fish</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> frigid water, slimy seaweed, crusty salt collecting on surfaces</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Arctic</h3><p>The main challenge in an arctic environment is the low temperature, as described in the @UUID[.mhP6TyghfJ6AE3ia] journal, but arctic environments also contain ice and snow.</p><p>• Ice: Acrobatics skill to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} without falling down (DC 12).</p><p>• Snow: Difficult terrain.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> blinding reflected sunlight, snowy plains, distant glaciers, deep crevasses, rocky cliffs, ice floes and bergs, animal tracks in snow</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> howling winds, drips of melting ice, utter quiet</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> clean air, half-frozen bog, lichen, seaweed</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> crunching snow, hard ice</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> frigid gales, light snowfall, pounding blizzard</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Desert</h3><p>Desert encompasses both sandy and rocky deserts as well as rugged badlands.</p><p>• Rubble: Rocky deserts are strewn with rubble, which is difficult terrain. Rubble dense enough to be walked over rather than navigated through requires Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance}as well (DC 15).</p><p>• Sand: Packed sand doesn’t impede movement, but loose sand is difficult terrain. Especially deep or loose sand requires a creature crossing it to use Acrobatics to Balance (DC 20).</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> blinding reflected sunlight, rolling dunes, a mirage, circling vultures</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling winds, cascading sand, insects at night</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> dust, desert herbs</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> coarse sand, warm rock, dry brush</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> direct heat, dust devil, sandstorm</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Forest</h3><p>These environments include jungles and other wooded areas.</p><p>• Trees: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a tree (DC 15). Trees that take up an entire 5-foot square on the map (or more) are big enough to provide standard cover; narrower trees don’t.</p><p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Heavy undergrowth gives standard cover to anyone in it, but it’s even harder to move through. Each square costs 10 extra feet of movement, not just 5!</p><p>• Vines: Acrobatics or Athletics skill to swing on a vine (DC 15).</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> towering trees, dense undergrowth, verdant canopies, colorful wildlife, dappled sunlight through the trees, mossy tree trunks, twisted roots</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling leaves, snapping branches, animal calls</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> decomposing vegetation, flowering plants, pine trees, earthy mushrooms</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> leaves crunching underfoot, scraping branches, water dripping from above, rough bark</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> still air, cool shade, sporadic breeze, rain on the canopy, branches coated in thick snow</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Mountain</h3><p>Mountain environments also include hills, which share many aspects of mountains, though not their more extreme features.</p><p>• Chasms: Athletics to make a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump} across a chasm or similar natural pit (DC 15 for a chasm 10 feet across; add 5 to the DC for every 5 feet wider). Failing to make the jump means taking bludgeoning damage from the fall equal to half the distance fallen. Alternatively, creatures can take the safer but slower route of Climbing down the near side of the chasm and then ascending the far side to get across. Good depths for chasms are 30 feet or 50 feet. Much deeper, and the fall is likely to kill a hero!</p><p>• Cliffs and Slopes: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a cliff (DC 10 for sloped cliffs, 15 for steep cliffs, or 20 for sheer cliffs or steep ones with few handholds). Without extensive safety precautions, such as having a creature farther up secure a rope, a critical failure can result in significant falling damage.</p><p>• Lava: A volcano might have small lava flows. Just the heat from being near lava is harmful, dealing 1d6 fire damage each round to anyone within 10 feet. Going into the lava is almost certain death for anyone not immune to fire. It deals 20d6 fire damage every round!</p><p>• Rubble and Scree: Difficult terrain. Especially deep or pervasive rubble requires Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} as well (DC 15).</p><p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Thick undergrowth on mountains is rare and follows the rules found under forests.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> bare cliffs, snow caps, hardy trees, slopes littered with scree, fallen rocks, birds flying on currents, fog among the peaks</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> howling wind, falling rocks, clear echoes, crunch of rocks underfoot, distant avalanche</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> blowing dust, pine trees, fresh snow</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> rough stone, powdery snow, unstable rubble</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> swirling clouds, chill of high altitude, direct sunlight, powerful wind and rain</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Plains</h3><p>The plains environment encompasses grasslands, such as savannas and farmland. Such terrain is usually fairly flat and easy to traverse.</p><p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Thick undergrowth in plains is rare (usually planted hedges or tall crops like corn) and follows the rules found under forests.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> grass waving gently, scattered wildflowers, rocky outcroppings or boulders, the curve of the horizon</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> rustling wind, birdsong, distant sounds carried far</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> fresh air, earthy soil, distant carcasses</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> touch of tall grass, rasp of scrub brush, crunch of dry dirt</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> cooling of gentle wind, heat of direct sunlight, massive black thunderclouds</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Swamp</h3><p>Wetlands are the most common kind of swamp, but this category also includes drier marshes such as moors.</p><p>• Bogs: Shallow bogs are difficult terrain for Medium creatures. Squares in deep bogs cost Medium creatures 10 extra feet of Speed per square, not just 5! If a bog is deep enough that a creature can’t reach the bottom, the creature has to use Athletics to Swim (DC 12).</p><p>• Undergrowth: Difficult terrain. Heavy undergrowth gives standard cover to anyone in it, but it’s even harder to move through. Each square costs 10 extra feet of movement, not just 5!</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> lush leaves, clouds of gnats, algae-coated water, shacks on stilts, darting fish</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> croaking frogs, chirping insects, bubbling waters, splashing</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> rich moss and algae, pungent swamp gases</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> pushing through floating detritus, tangling creepers, thick mud</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> oppressive humidity, still air, pouring rain, rays of sunlight</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Underground</h3><p>Most underground environments consist of caves and other natural formations. Artificial dungeons and ruins combine underground features with urban features, like stairs and walls. Deep underground vaults have some of the same terrain features as mountains, such as chasms and cliffs.</p><p>• Cliffs and Slopes: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} a cliff (DC 10 for sloped cliffs, 15 for steep cliffs, or 20 for sheer cliffs or steep ones with few handholds). Without safety precautions like a creature farther up securing a rope, a critical failure can result in significant falling damage (bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance fallen).</p><p>• Floors: Natural cavern floors are rarely flat. They tend to have abrupt changes in elevation that are difficult terrain or require using Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} (DC 10 or 12).</p><p>• Ledges: Moving across a narrow ledge requires using Acrobatics to Balance (DC 12).</p><p>• Magma: Caverns deep underground might have magma flowing within. Just the heat from being near magma is harmful, causing 1d6 fire damage each round to anyone within 10 feet. Going into the magma is almost certain death for anyone not immune to fire. It deals 20d6 fire damage every round!</p><p>• Rubble: Difficult terrain. Especially deep or pervasive rubble requires Acrobatics to Balance on when crossing it as well (DC 17).</p><p>• Walls: Athletics to Climb a natural cave wall (DC 20). Since most caves are formed by water, cave walls are often damp, making the DC 22 or 25.</p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> winding passages, sputtering yellow torchlight, uneven or cracked floors, ancient writings or architecture, stalagmites and stalactites</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> dripping condensation, scurrying rats or insects, distant clunks of machinery, tinny echoes of your voices and footsteps</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> staleness of still air, sulfur, tang of metal deposits</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> rough rock walls, stone smoothed by erosion, cobwebs</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> chill of underground air, geothermal heat</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Urban</h3><p>Urban environments include open city spaces as well as buildings. The building information in this section also applies to ruins and constructed dungeons.</p><p>• Crowds: Crowded thoroughfares and similar areas are difficult terrain. You might allow a creature to persuade a crowd to part and allow it to pass using Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance.</p><p>A crowd exposed to an obvious danger, like a fire or a rampaging monster, attempts to move away from the danger as quickly as possible, but a crowd is slowed by its own mass. A fleeing crowd typically moves at a Speed of 25 feet, potentially trampling or leaving behind slower-moving members of the crowd.</p><p>• Doors: Opening a door takes an Interact action. Locked doors require a creature to use Thievery to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H]{Pick a Lock}. The DC and number of successes required to open the lock depend on the quality of the lock. Remember that a critical success is worth two successes!</p><p>• Rooftops: Flat roofs are easy to move across. Angled roofs require creatures to use Acrobatics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} (DC 13) or, if they’re especially steep, Athletics to Climb (DC 13).</p><p>Hurtling from roof to roof often requires using Athletics for a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump}, though some buildings are close enough to Leap between. A High Jump might be necessary to reach a higher roof.</p><p>• Sewers: Sewers are generally 10 feet or more below street level and are equipped with ladders or other means to ascend and descend. Raised paths along the walls allow sewer workers access, while channels in the center carry waste. Sewers grates require 2 or more Interact actions to open, though they might be locked using the rules for locked doors above.</p><p>• Stairs: Difficult terrain for creatures moving up them, normal for creatures moving down.</p><p>• Walls: Athletics to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} (DC 18 for a constructed stone wall, DC 20 for a brick wall).</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> milling crowds, domesticated animals, multi-story buildings, trash blowing in the streets</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> town criers, shouting children, rattling wagon wheels</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> freshly baked bread, chimney smoke, industrial fumes, perfume, sewage</p><p><strong>Textures:</strong> smooth cobblestones</p><p><strong>Weather:</strong> rain on the rooftops</p><h3>In Otari</h3><p>These details are especially pronounced in @UUID[JournalEntry.sgxbTVNpwJ0jWBvw].</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Descriptions</span></strong></span></p><p><strong>Sights:</strong> docked boats laden with fish, lumber sliding down the road toward the dock</p><p><strong>Smells:</strong> caught fish, freshly cut lumber</p><p><strong>Sounds:</strong> sawmill blades whirring</p></article></section>"

Creatures viewed through significantly thick fog have the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition. You decide the distance of that concealment, but it’s usually around 30 feet for a light fog and 15 feet for a heavy fog.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Precipitation</h3><p>Precipitation includes rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Wet precipitation douses flames, and frozen precipitation can create areas of snow or ice on the ground. Drizzle or light snowfall has little mechanical effect beyond limited visibility.</p><p>Most forms of precipitation impose circumstance penalties on vision-based Perception checks, usually a -1 circumstance penalty or -2 for heavier precipitation. Hail often is sparser but loud, instead causing a -2 circumstance penalty on hearing-based Perception checks. Especially heavy precipitation, such as a downpour of rain or heavy snow, might make creatures concealed if they’re far away.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Thunderstorms</h3><p>High winds and heavy precipitation accompany many thunderstorms. There’s also a very small chance that a creature might be struck by lightning during a storm. A lightning strike usually deals [[/r 5d6 #electricity]] electricity damage.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Temperature</h3><p>In most places, even if it’s very cold or hot, the weather isn’t actively dangerous. However, temperatures of 105º F and above or 12º F or below can be harmful! For every hour spent in temperatures from 105º to 114º, a creature takes [[/r 1d6 #fire]] fire damage. For every hour spent in temperatures from -21º to 12º, a creature takes [[/r 1d6 #cold]] cold damage. Temperatures beyond those ranges are too dangerous for characters of levels 1-3.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h3>Wind</h3><p>Wind imposes a penalty on Perception checks to hear and on physical ranged attacks such as arrows. This circumstance penalty is -1 for a weak wind or -2 for a stronger wind. Powerful windstorms can make physical ranged attacks impossible! Wind snuffs out handheld flames. Particularly strong winds might require a creature to succeed at a DC 15 Athletics check each time it attempts to move. On a failure, the creature doesn’t move on that action, and on a critical failure, it’s knocked back 5 feet and falls prone. Any moderate or strong wind is difficult terrain for a flying monster moving against the wind.</p></article></section>"

If you're making new characters, your GM can create new sheets for you by clicking \"Create Actor\" on the actors tab of the sidebar. They'll need to assign the actor to you as well, which can be done by right-clicking on it and giving you the \"Owner\" permission under \"Configure Permissions\".</p><p>If you could use some guidance on learning to read and use the Pathfinder Second Edition system's character sheets, you can use the system's wiki linked above to familiarise yourself with the fields and tabs it has to offer, as well as some specific advice for playing certain classes.</p><h3>Useful Tools</h3><p>During character creation, or later on as you level up your hero, you're going to be adding actions, feats, items, spells, and other features to your character sheet. The system includes all of this data for you- you need only apply it to your character!</p><p>On the \"compendiums\" tab of your sidebar, at the bottom, there is a button labelled \"Compendium Browser\". When clicked, this opens an interface which allows you to search and filter through all of the rules content included in the system. You can use this to quickly find the features you'd like to choose, and then drag them from this window onto your character sheet. It's as simple as that!</p><h3>Character Creation Rules</h3><p>In some places, the rules or character options presented in the Pathfinder Beginner Box PDF may differ from those this used in these journal pages or in the PF2E system. This is because the Beginner Box presents a simplified and streamlined set of rules in the interest of making the system a little easier to learn.</p><p>Because a virtual tabletop handles a lot of the minutia and complexity that comes from learning the mechanics of a new game system, we've chosen to stick to the full rules as outlined in the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook.</p><p>However, you're welcome to refer back to the Beginner Box PDF if you would like to play with those rules instead. If you aren't sure where you should be looking, make sure that you ask your GM. Once you have the rules in hand, you can use the steps here to guide your process!</p><h3>Pathfinder Society</h3><p>If you're planning on running the adventure Menace Under Otari for Pathfinder Society organised play, it becomes especially important that you take into account which version of the rules you use to create your characters.

Typically in Pathfinder, a single grid square is equal to 5 feet, the space a Medium creature (like each of the heroes) would occupy. Small creatures also occupy this space, but typically have tokens scaled down just slightly by the Pathfinder System to give a visual cue of their smaller size. Large creatures occupy a space of 2x2 squares, and each size increments this space by 1 in both dimensions.</p><p>Foundry VTT provides a number of ways to move a controlled token, but the most common is to use the arrow keys on your keyboard or to click and drag the token from one position to another. During encounters or other times when movement is limited, you can measure your movements by holding the ctrl key, clicking your token, and placing waypoints on the way to your destination by clicking as many times as you'd like. This will display a measurement of the distance that move would cover. Pressing the space bar while the measurement is visible will execute the move, and your token will progress through the way points to your destination.</p></article></section><h2>Difficult Terrain</h2><p>Whenever creatures need to cross terrain that’s hard to move through, such as snow or underbrush, you can use the rules for difficult terrain. Difficult terrain costs 5 more feet of movement to move into.</p><h2>Reactions to Movement</h2><p>Some reactions are triggered by a creature using an action with the move trait. The most notable example is Reactive Strike, which fighters and some monsters have. A creature with Reactive Strike can use it when a nearby enemy uses an action with the move trait or when an enemy leaves a nearby square. The Step basic action doesn’t trigger reactions based on movement and neither does movement caused by other creatures, like a Shove.</p><h2>Moving Through a Creature</h2><p>You can move through the space of any creature willing to let you. If you want to move through an unwilling creature’s space, you can Tumble Through that creature’s space using Acrobatics. You can’t end your turn in a square occupied by another creature, though you can end a move action in its square provided that you immediately use another move action to leave that square. If two creatures end up in the same square by accident, the GM determines which one is forced out of the square (or whether one falls over and gains the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone condition}).</p><p>You can stand in the same square as a prone creature if that creature is willing, unconscious, or dead and is your size or smaller. The GM might allow you to climb atop a larger creature that’s dead or unconscious in some situations.</p><h2>Falling</h2><p>When you fall more than 5 feet, upon landing you take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell. If you take any damage from a fall, you fall over and gain the prone condition.</p><p>You can Grab an Edge as a reaction to reduce the damage from some falls. Roll a Reflex save against the DC to Climb the surface (as chosen by the GM). If you succeed, you catch yourself and take damage as though the fall were 20 feet shorter (or 30 feet shorter on a critical success). On a critical failure, you take 10 bludgeoning damage for every 20 feet you’ve fallen, then keep falling!</p><section class=\"character-creation\"><article><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/movement-example.webp\" /></article><article><h2>Moving on a Grid</h2><p>When a character moves on a grid, every square of the play area is 5 feet across in the game world.</p><p>Because moving diagonally covers more ground, you count that movement differently.

He moves 5 feet horizontally, then his first diagonal costs 5 more feet. Now his second diagonal costs 10 feet! For the last square of movement, taking another diagonal would take 5 feet, but moving horizontally into the rubble would take 10 feet because the rubble is difficult terrain.

Every player contributes to the story by responding to situations according to the personality and abilities of their character, describing their actions as each scene leads into the next. You'll determine whether your hero succeeds or fails at the actions they attempt by rolling dice, which adds an element of chance, and then adding your hero's statistics, which represent their strengths.</p><h2>Narrating Actions</h2><p>Pathfinder’s about more than just numbers. You and your friends are cooperating to tell a story! As you prepare to use your actions, describe your character's attitude and what they want to get done. Talk about how you execute your attack or the flashy movement you use as you cast your spell. The GM can do the same for the monsters.</p><section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Dice</h2><p><a class=\"entity-link\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em class=\"fas fa-book\"> </em>Knowledge Base: Dice</a></p></header><article><p>Pathfinder uses a set of six different kinds of dice. Each die has a different number of sides- four, six, eight, or more. The name of each die uses the letter \"d\" followed by the number of sides on the die.</p><p>When the game tells you to roll multiple dice, the number before the \"d\" tells you how many of that die to roll. For example, \"4d6\" means you should roll a d6 four times and add the results together.

Text that is formatted using italics refers to a spell or magic item, such as <em>light </em>or a <em>healing potion</em>, to help make it instantly recognizable.</p></aside><p>You'll see game terms like \"saving throw\" and \"Hit Points\" as you create a hero and start playing the game. You need only a general idea of these terms for now, and they’re explained more later on.</p><h3>Armor Class (AC)</h3><p>This number is the Difficulty Class for an attack. It represents how hard it is to hit a hero or a monster in combat.</p><h3>Attack</h3><p>When a creature tries to harm another creature, it makes a Strike or uses some other attack action. A success on the roll for that action is called a hit, and a critical success is sometimes called a critical hit. A hero might Strike with a weapon or their fist, grapple with their hands, or attack with a spell. Attacking more than once on your turn gets harder with each attack, giving you a penalty called a multiple attack penalty.</p><h3>Bonuses and Penalties</h3><p>Bonuses and penalties apply to checks and certain statistics. There are several types of bonuses and penalties. If you have more than one bonus of the same type, you use only the highest one. Likewise, you use only the worst penalty of each type.</p><h3>Condition</h3><p>An ongoing effect that changes how a creature can act, or that alters some of their statistics, is called a condition.</p><h3>Durations</h3><p>Some actions have effects that last longer than the actions themselves. These effects are measured by a duration. Something might last until the end of your next turn, for 1 minute, or for other lengths. Once the duration is over, the effect ends.</p><p>When a duration is measured in rounds, the remaining duration decreases by 1 at the start of each turn of the creature that created the effect. If you need to track something that lasts 1 minute in combat, 1 minute is 10 rounds. Most fights don’t last that long, so you might not need to worry about it! Some durations last until certain things happen or stop happening, instead of a certain amount of time.</p><h3>Feat</h3><p>A feat is an ability your hero can use. It might come from their ancestry, background, or class. Some feats grant the ability to use special actions.</p><h3>Hit Points (HP)</h3><p>Hit Points represent how badly injured a creature can be before it falls unconscious and begins dying. Damage decreases Hit Points on a 1-to-1 basis, while healing restores Hit Points at the same rate.</p><h3>Level</h3><p>A level is a number that measures overall power. The rules in this book can take a hero to 3rd level, and those in the Player Core rulebook elevate them all the way to 20th level! Creatures, items, and other rules elements also have levels, telling you how powerful they are compared to one another. </p><h3>Nonplayer Character (NPC)</h3><p>A nonplayer character is controlled by the GM. NPCs interact with players and help advance the story.</p><h3>Perception</h3><p>Perception measures your hero's ability to notice hidden objects or unusual situations and usually determines how quickly they spring into action in combat.</p><h3>Proficiency</h3><p>Proficiency measures your hero’s aptitude for each statistic. It has three ranks: untrained, trained, and expert. If you're untrained, your proficiency bonus is +0. If you’re trained, your proficiency bonus equals your level plus 2, and if you’re an expert, your proficiency bonus equals your level plus 4.</p><h3>Rank</h3><p>Spells have a rank to determine their overall power. The spells in this book are 1st or 2nd rank, but more powerful spells exist in the Player Core rulebook. </p><h3>Round</h3><p>A round represents about 6 seconds of time during a combat encounter in which all participants get a chance to act.</p><h3>Saving Throw (Save)</h3><p>Some dangerous effects let you attempt a saving throw to mitigate their harm. You attempt a saving throw automatically- you don't have to use an action or a reaction. </p><p>There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (to resist diseases and poisons), Reflex (to evade effects that can be dodged), and Will (to resist effects that target the mind).</p><h3>Basic Saving Throw</h3><p>Some spells use a \"basic saving throw\". These work like any other save but use the same degrees of success:</p><p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> The creature takes no damage.</p><p><strong>Success:</strong> The creature takes half the listed damage.</p><p><strong>Failure: </strong>The creature takes the full listed damage.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> The creature takes double the listed damage.</p><h3>Speed</h3><p>Speed is the distance a creature can move using a single action.</p><h3>Trait</h3><p>A trait is a keyword that appears on an action so other rules can interact with it by referencing the trait. For instance, a fighter can make an Reactive Strike against someone who uses an action with the manipulate or move trait. Traits appear in boxes beneath the title of a rules element, or in parentheses following an action in a stat block.</p>"

Roll the kind and number of dice indicated by your weapon or spell, and add any numbers listed for that ability (for example, many weapons say to add your Strength to the damage for melee Strikes).</p> <p>The damage you deal has a type, such as piercing or fire, which can matter since some creatures take more or less damage depending on the type.</p> <p>Damage you deal decreases the target’s Hit Points by the same amount, so a creature that takes 6 damage loses 6 Hit Points. If penalties to an attack would reduce its damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage. For example, if you threw a dagger and rolled a 1 on the damage roll while you had a –1 penalty to damage rolls, you still deal 1 damage to your target.</p> <h2>Doubling and Halving</h2> <p>You might need to double or halve your damage, depending on the action you used. For instance, many spells deal half damage if your enemy succeeds at its save, full damage if it fails, and double damage if it critically fails. You double or halve the damage after rolling rather than changing the number of dice you roll. Add any bonuses or penalties before you double or halve. Special damage—like the extra damage from a rogue’s sneak attack—is doubled or halved, too. If you halve damage that’s an odd number, round down.</p> <h2>Persistent Damage</h2> <p>Persistent damage, like bleeding or being on fire, hurts you over time. When you gain persistent damage, you don’t take it right away. Instead, you take it at the end of your turn each round. After you take the damage, you attempt a DC 15 flat check (roll a 15 or higher on a d20 without adding anything) to see if you recover from the persistent damage.</p> <h2>Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances</h2> <p>Damage might affect a creature differently if it has an immunity, weakness, or resistance to that damage type. Immunity prevents the creature from taking any damage at all. A weakness causes the creature to increase damage they take by the listed amount, and resistance prevents the listed amount of damage. So if you used a spell that deals 10 fire damage, a creature that’s immune to fire would take no damage, a creature with weakness 5 to fire would lose 15 Hit Points, and a creature with resistance 5 to fire would lose 5 Hit Points. This adjustment applies to every instance of damage, so if you made three Strikes that deal bludgeoning damage against a creature with resistance 5 to bludgeoning damage, it would take 5 less damage from each of the three strikes! Usually, heroes don’t have immunities or weaknesses, though the resist energy wizard spell can give resistance to some damage types.</p> <p>Immunity matters for more than just damage. A creature that’s immune to a certain trait is completely unaffected by anything with that trait, and one with immunity to a condition can’t gain that condition. For instance, a creature without a mind lists “mental” in its immunities. Not only would it take no mental damage, but a spell with the mental trait wouldn’t do anything to it at all! In some cases, a creature is immune to part of an attack or spell but not the rest, and the GM determines whether this is the case. For instance, if you hit a monster that’s immune to fire with a flaming sword, the sword itself would still deal slashing damage, but the extra fire damage wouldn’t do anything.</p> <h2>Damaging Items</h2> <p>The rules for attacking and damaging items differ from the rules for creatures. Attacks and spells don’t normally damage items, except for traps, unless specified otherwise. If you have a shield, it can take damage if you use the Shield Block reaction.</p> <section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /> <h2>Applying Damage in Foundry</h2> </header> <article> <p>Beneath any damage roll in chat, you'll see a row of buttons that allow you to easily apply damage to selected tokens. While you have a token selected, pressing the \"<strong>damage</strong>\", \"<strong>double</strong>\", or \"<strong>half</strong>\" buttons will apply that much damage. There's also \"<strong>heal</strong>\", which instead restores that many hit points. If your character is using a shield, and you would like to block a hit, then you can toggle the \"<strong>block</strong>\" button on before doing this to subtract the appropriate amount of damage.</p> <p>This helpful timesaving feature is widely useful, but it does have limitations. Currently, the system does not automate damage resistances, weaknesses, or immunities- if your heroes or the NPCs they are facing have such abilities, you may need to adjust the damage taken.</p> </article> </section>"

Pathfinder has many types of checks, from skill checks to attack rolls to saving throws, but they all follow the basic steps explained below: roll the d20, calculate your result, and compare that result to a target number called a difficulty class (DC) to determine whether you succeed or fail.</p><p>All checks use the same formula:</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">d20 + statistic + bonuses and penalties = result</p><p>Checks and DCs both come in many forms. When you swing a sword at a monster, you’ll make an attack roll, and its Armor Class is the DC. If you leap across a chasm, you’ll attempt an Athletics skill check with a DC based on how far you’re trying to jump. When trying to remember information about an ancient text, you’ll roll a skill check to Recall Knowledge with a skill and DC determined by the GM.</p><p>These are some common types of checks and DCs:</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>Check</p></th><th><p>Statistic</p></th><th><p>Difficulty Class (DC)</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Weapon or fist attack</p></td><td><p>Attack bonus</p></td><td><p>Armor Class (AC) of the target</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Spell attack</p></td><td><p>Spell attack roll</p></td><td><p>Armor Class (AC) of the target</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Saving throw against a spell</p></td><td><p>Fortitude, Reflex, or Will</p></td><td><p>Spell DC of the caster</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Perception check</p></td><td><p>Perception</p></td><td><p>Stealth DC of a hiding creature or DC set by the GM to find an object in the environment</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stealth check</p></td><td><p>Stealth Skill</p></td><td><p>Perception DC of observers</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Rolling a Check</h1><section class=\"character-creation\"><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 1: Roll</h2><p>Start by rolling your d20! Pay attention to whether you rolled a 20 or a 1 on the die because that does something special when you determine success or failure.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 2: Calculate the Result</h2><p>Add the number you rolled on the d20 to the statistic you’re using (such as your attack bonus or your Stealth), and add any special bonuses and penalties that apply. This total is your result.</p><h3>Bonuses and Penalties</h3><p>Sometimes you’ll have a bonus or penalty to add to your roll in addition to the statistic you’re using. For instance, a spell might give you a bonus to an attack roll. Such a bonus might be labelled, like a circumstance bonus, status bonus, or item bonus. You can benefit from only the highest bonus with a given label. For example, if two spells are affecting you, each giving you a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, your total status bonus would still just be +1, not +2. This works the same way for multiple circumstance or item bonuses, too. But if you get a +1 status bonus and a +1 circumstance bonus to an attack roll, you add both! Penalties can have labels too, and they work the same way, except that the number is negative.</p><p>Anything without a label is cumulative. For example, the penalty for making multiple attacks in a round and the penalty for attacking at a long range with a ranged weapon don’t have labels, so both would apply to an attack that wasn’t your first of the round and was made at a long range.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Step 3: Determine Success</h2><p>Often, it’s important to determine not only if you succeed or fail, but also how spectacularly you succeed or fail. Exceptional results can cause you to critically succeed or critically fail.</p><p><strong>Critical Success:</strong> You exceed the DC by 10 or more.</p><p><strong>Success: </strong>You meet or exceed the DC.</p><p><strong>Failure: </strong>Your result is lower than the DC.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure: </strong>Your result is lower than the DC by 10 or more.</p><p>The action you’re using tells you what happens depending on how well you rolled. For instance, if you attacked with a Strike, you’d deal double damage on a critical success, the normal amount of damage on a success, and no damage at all on a failure or critical failure. If an action doesn’t say anything special happens on a critical failure, a critical failure has the same result as a regular failure. For a Strike, a critical failure is no different from a regular failure. Likewise, if an action doesn’t say something special happens on a critical success, it has the same effect as a success.</p><h3>Rolling a 20 or a 1</h3><p>Rolling the highest or lowest number on a d20 has some special rules.</p><p><strong>If you roll a 20 on the d20</strong>, use a result one step better than what you’d normally get based on your roll. This changes a critical failure to a failure, a failure to a success, and a success to a critical success. Usually, this means you critically succeed!</p><p><strong>If you roll a 1 on the d20</strong>, do the opposite and use a result one step worse. This changes a critical success to a success, a success to a failure, and a failure to a critical failure. Usually, this means you critically fail.</p></article></section><h3>Calculating DCs</h3><p>For many checks, you’ll compare your result to another creature’s DC, with Strikes, the DC of your attack roll is your target’s Armor Class (AC). Sometimes an enemy’s check uses your DC, like comparing the result of an Intimidation check to Demoralize you to your Will DC. If you need a DC for something that’s normally a statistic, such as a Will DC, just add 10 to the statistic to get the DC. For example, a creature with a Will of +5 has a Will DC of 15.</p><p>For other checks, like an Athletics check to Climb a steep cliff, the Game Master sets the DC for you. They have information on how to do so in the @UUID[JournalEntry.S1UnJk4t55aRFaCs.JournalEntryPage.x3B30n5dtJ8XNUnz] handout.</p><h2>Special Rules for Checks</h2><p>Some types of checks follow special rules.</p><h3>Flat Checks</h3><p>When something’s based purely on chance, you’ll attempt a flat check. A flat check never includes any modifiers, bonuses, or penalties—you just roll a d20 and compare the result on the die to the DC.</p><h3>Secret Checks</h3><p>The secret trait appears on anything that uses secret checks. You use the normal formula for the check, but the GM rolls the d20 in secret. Instead of revealing the result, the GM simply describes the information or effects determined by the check’s result.</p><h3>Helping Someone</h3><p>You can @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW]{Aid} someone when they attempt a skill check or attack roll to potentially give them a bonus. This requires preparing to help them, usually by spending an action or more on your turn, then using a reaction when they attempt their skill check or attack roll. When you use your reaction, attempt a skill check or attack roll, usually the same type of roll as the one you’re trying to help.</p><h3>Attacks</h3><p>Anything that has the attack trait follows some special rules. You can read about @UUID[.rj7hexKclZx0NA3s] here.</p>"

There are three main types of attack rolls: melee attack rolls, ranged attack rolls, and spell attack rolls. Some skills can be used to make attacks, such as Athletics being used to Grapple someone rather than damage them.</p><h3>Multiple Attack Penalty</h3><p>If you attack more than once on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty. This penalty is -5 for your second attack, and -10 for your third and any subsequent attacks. Some abilities or features, such as a weapon's agile trait, reduce your Multiple Attack Penalty.</p><p>Always calculate your multiple attack penalty for the weapon you’re using on that attack. If you attack with a longsword, then a shortsword (which has the agile trait), the attack with the shortsword is at –4, even though your first attack was with a weapon that isn’t agile.</p><p>The penalty resets every turn. It also applies only during your turn, so you don’t have to keep track of it if you can perform an Attack of Opportunity or a similar reaction that lets you make a Strike on someone else’s turn.</p><h3>Range Penalty</h3><p>Ranged and thrown weapons are less accurate against targets farther away. The weapon’s range increment determines this interval. As long as your target is at or within the listed range increment, also called the first range increment, you take no penalty to the attack roll. Beyond that distance, you take a –2 penalty for each additional increment beyond the first. Both the multiple attack penalty and range penalty can apply to the same attack, giving a big penalty to your second or third attack against someone far away!</p><h3>Light and Darkness</h3><p>There are three levels of light: bright light, dim light, and darkness. The game’s rules assume you’re in bright light, so most of the time you don’t have to worry about any special rules. Areas in shadow or lit by weak light sources are in dim light. Creatures and objects in dim light have the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition, meaning any attack or other effect that would target them fails unless the creature trying to target them succeeds at a DC 5 flat check (rolling a 5 or higher on a d20 without adding anything).</p><p>A creature with darkvision or low-light vision can see in the dim light and targets creatures in it normally. Areas without any light at all are in darkness. A creature or object in darkness can’t be seen unless the creature looking for it has darkvision. A creature without darkvision or another means of perceiving in darkness is blinded while in darkness, though it might be able to see illuminated areas beyond the darkness. When you’re blinded, all terrain is difficult terrain and you take a –4 status penalty to Perception checks that rely on sight. If you try to attack or affect a target you can’t see due to darkness or for any other reason, you fail unless you succeed at a DC 11 flat check.</p><p>Some actions have you select one or more specific targets. You can’t select a target if it’s out of range, if you can’t tell where it is, if it doesn’t match restrictions on who you can target, or if some other ability prevents it from being targeted.</p><p>Some effects target an ally. This must be someone on your side, often another hero, but it might be a bystander you’re trying to protect. You aren’t your own ally. If it isn’t clear, the GM decides who counts as an ally or an enemy. An ability that targets a willing creature doesn’t do anything unless the target allows you to affect them. Only you can decide whether your hero is willing, and the GM decides whether an NPC is willing.</p><p>Melee attacks can target someone only if they’re adjacent—right next to the attacker on the grid. Being next to them diagonally on the corner of their space is still adjacent. Some abilities, like the Lunge fighter feat or the enlarge spell, let someone reach creatures further away.

You can quickly mark your targets by hovering the mouse over a token and pressing <strong>'T'</strong> on your keyboard. To target multiple tokens, a player can hold <strong>shift</strong> while pressing T. This provides a small colored indicated which matches the color a player has been assigned, and makes it easy to see who's targeting what.</p><p>The Pathfinder Second Edition game system also automates a number of options, such as comparing AC to see if your attack should hit, or providing for conditional bonuses such as Sneak Attacks. These automations only function if you have an enemy targeted when you perform your action.</p></article></section><h3>Cover</h3><p>When you’re behind an obstacle that could block weapons, guard you against explosions, and make you harder to detect, you’re behind cover. Standard cover gives you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, to Reflex saves against area effects, and to Stealth checks to Hide, Sneak, or otherwise avoid detection.</p><p>Creatures give lesser cover, which grants a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. A creature with standard cover can attempt to use the Stealth skill to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.XMcnh4cSI32tljXa]{Hide}, but lesser cover isn’t sufficient for using Stealth.</p><p>You might simultaneously have cover against one creature and not another. Cover applies only if your path to the target is partially blocked. If a creature is entirely behind a wall or the like, you typically can’t target it at all. The GM decides whether you have cover and whether it’s lesser or standard.</p><p>If you and an ally are on opposite sides or corners of an enemy, you’re flanking that enemy. This gives the creature the flat-footed condition (giving it a –2 circumstance penalty to AC) against attacks from anyone flanking it. If you stop flanking the creature, the flat-footed condition ends.</p><p>You can flank or help an ally flank only if you meet all three of the following conditions:</p><p>• No condition or effect is preventing you from acting or attacking.</p><p>• You’re holding melee weapons or able to make a fist attack.</p><p>• You’re close enough to reach the enemy with an attack.</p><section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Automated Flanking</h2></header><article><p>The Pathfinder Second Edition game system includes automation of flanking and appropriately enables flanking bonuses for cases where they would apply, removing the need to keep track of it yourself.</p><p>A simple way of understanding how this automation works is to consider that there are two \"teams\", Tokens linked to actors that are owned by players, and tokens whose actors are not. By default, all player characters are on one team and all NPCs are on another, but you can change an NPC's alliance by clicking on the \"Configure\" button in the header of their actor sheet.</p></article></section>"

You can use skills to figure out what your character knows, how far your character can jump, and even how well your character can influence people!</p><h2>Types of Skill Checks</h2><p>You can find a list of skills and some of the skill actions or activities that they can be used in in the @UUID[.UexG8C5tSZQUdV7z] journal page.</p><h3>Skill Actions</h3><p>Each skill has special actions you can use. Some of these actions can be attempted by anyone, but others require a hero to have the trained proficiency rank in the skill (or better).</p><h3>Exploration Activities</h3><p>Some skill activities have the exploration trait. These usually take a minute or more, and can't be used during an encounter. If you're not sure whether you have the time to use one of these activities, ask your GM.</p><h3>Secret Checks</h3><p>If an action has the secret trait, the GM rolls the check for you and tells you what happens without revealing the result of the roll. Secret checks happen when your knowledge is imperfect, like when you’re searching for a hidden creature or object, attempting to deceive someone, or remembering some piece of lore. This way, you as the player don’t know things that your character wouldn’t.</p><h2>Calculating Skill Modifiers</h2><h3>Ability Modifier</h3><p>Every skill uses an ability modifier, which is listed next to the skill- for example, Stealth uses your Dexterity.</p><h3>Proficiency</h3><p>Many of the statistics on your character sheet will include a proficiency bonus. If your hero’s proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, the proficiency bonus for that statistic equals your hero’s level + 2. If it’s expert, the proficiency bonus equals your hero’s level + 4. If your hero is untrained in that statistic, their proficiency bonus is +0.</p><h3>Armor and Skills</h3><p>If you wear armor, you might take a penalty to skills that use your Strength or Dexterity. Having a good Strength lets you ignore this penalty. You'll find out whether the penalty applies when you choose your armor.</p>"

The Giant Spider token has already been placed on the scene for you, but like the rats in the previous encounter is hidden from player view. When the heroes enter this area, read the following aloud.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">The tunnel continues deeper underground, eventually opening into a large chamber. Patches of glowing blue fungus cling to the ceiling and provide dim light. You can just barely make out vast strands of webbing across the floor and walls of this cavern, stretching between stalactites like shimmering curtains.</p><p>This fight uses the same rules as the first fight against the rats, but it also incorporates skill checks when dealing with webs and includes a new kind of @UUID[JournalEntry.OoPjlnYYGLn5KPZy.JournalEntryPage.DyVmklA6nwuY8sgU]—a saving throw—to resist the spider’s poisonous bite!</p><p>This chamber is home to a very big spider, waiting to ambush anything that wanders through its web. The webs aren’t sticky enough to make anyone who touches them unable to move, but they do slow characters down. Each square that has webbing in it is difficult terrain—terrain that’s particularly hard to move through. Moving into a square of difficult terrain costs an extra 5 feet of movement, and a creature can’t Step into a square of difficult terrain. The spider isn’t affected by its webs and can move normally throughout the chamber.</p><p>When the players enter the chamber, the spider is in its lair in the northeast corner of the room. It does not emerge to attack until someone touches one of its webs. Anyone trying to cross through the room without touching the webs must attempt an @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:15]{Acrobatics Skill Check} to carefully balance on rocks and narrow ledges. If anyone fails the check, the spider senses them in the room and emerges to attack.</p><p>The fight with the spider plays out very much like the combat with the rats. As soon as someone touches one of the webs or fails an Acrobatics check to balance while crossing the room, call for everyone to roll for initiative—usually using Perception, or Stealth for anyone who was hiding at the time. The spider rolls Perception for its initiative.</p><p>After you have everyone’s initiative results, start the first round of combat with the character who rolled the highest initiative result. Each character gets to use 3 actions when their turn comes up, and when everyone has had a turn, start over again at the beginning.</p><p>The heroes might avoid this fight by carefully moving around the webs. They might also flee from the spider. The spider refuses to leave this area, retreating to its webbed den in the northeast if all the heroes flee.</p><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/icon-monster.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Spider Fight</h2><p>@Actor[6NdqvKIlxo4cGhf8]{Giant Spider}</p></header><article><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>Whenever the spider manages to successfully attack a character with its fangs, it injects poison as part of the attack. Whenever a character is subjected to poison, they must attempt a special check called a saving throw to resist its effects. There are three types of saving throw: a Fortitude save is typically for resisting poison or disease, a Reflex save is for dodging away from falling debris or avoiding a deadly beam from a spell, and a Will save is usually for resisting spells and magic that befuddle the mind.</p><p>Anyone who is bitten by the spider must immediately attempt a Fortitude saving throw by clicking the d20 icon under \"Fortitude\" in the saves section of their character sheet. If the result is equal to or greater than 16, they resist the poison and suffer no ill effect. If the result is less than 16, the poison takes hold! The details of the poison's effects are included in the spider's stat block.</p><h3>Ranged Strikes</h3><p>The giant spider also has a special ranged Strike that lets it throw webbing to trap a nearby creature. Unlike for a melee Strike, the giant spider doesn’t have to be adjacent to a hero to target them with a ranged Strike—it can target a hero anywhere in the room. Otherwise, a ranged Strike works just like a melee Strike. Choose a target by hovering over the token and pressing T, then click the \"Strike+ 7\" button on the giant spider’s Web Strike, and then compare the total to the Armor Class of the target hero to see if it hits.</p><p>While ranged Strikes normally deal damage just like melee Strikes, this web Strike is special. If the attack roll is a success, the target doesn’t take any damage. Instead, the target is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} and can’t move out of their square until they successfully use the Escape basic action. You can apply the Immobilized effect by dragging it from this journal directly to the affected token. The target can attempt a check to Escape using the Acrobatics skill or Athletics skill, or a fists attack roll, and the DC is 17. Each attempt to Escape is a single action.</p><p>If the total result of the check to Escape is 17 or greater, the target breaks free from the webs and can move freely. You can remove the immobilization effect by right-clicking on the affected token, clicking the \"Assign Status Effects\" button on the right, and then right-clicking the immobilized effect. A stuck hero can still attack, cast spells, and otherwise act normally, but they can’t move from their current space on the map.</p></article></section><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>Sometimes challenges offer multiple ways for the heroes to overcome them. No matter how the heroes overcome a challenge, they earn XP for doing so- but only the first time they overcome it! If the heroes avoid the fight with the spider and you award them XP for doing so, they don't get more XP if they later go back and fight the spider.</p><p>The first time the heroes get past the spider, whether by defeating or avoiding it, award them each 40 XP.</p><section class=\"box-text treasure\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/icon-treasure.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Searching the Spider's Lair</h2><p>@Actor[PziNyZC7L7e9SsGr]{Spider's Lair}</p></header><article><p>Once the heroes defeat the spider, the players might think to check the spider's lair to see if there is anything of value hidden in the webs. Ask anyone who explores the area to attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:15]{Perception Check}. If they succeed, they spot a wrapped up bundle of bones and dried skin that looks like it was some sort of small, reptilian creature (in fact, it's a kobold, one of the creatures responsible for breaking into the basement of the fishery).</p><p>The bundle also contains a few items of value- a healing potion and a shortsword that has a small emerald in the pommel. While the sword isn't magical, the fine craftsmanship and precious gem make it worth 5 gp if sold.</p><h3>Loot Actors</h3><p>The Pathfinder Second Edition system includes compendiums containing every item released by Paizo under the OGL license, which makes handing out loot to players a breeze. To save you even more time, though, we've placed a special type of actor called a \"loot actor\" on the scene with the items ready for them to pick up. If your players locate the kobold's remains, you can simply reveal the actor on the map, and they'll be able to open its inventory and see (and claim!) the items within.</p><p>Several future rooms include loot actors like this one, so keep an eye out for these boxes!</p><h3>Special Items</h3><figure class=\"right shadow\"><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-items/healing-potion.webp\" width=\"100\" /></figure><p>One of the items inside the loot sheet- the @Item[LKjaRu3wDgEBpb9C]{Healing Potion}- is a magical consumable.

To do this, before you reveal the loot sheet, click on the question mark icon on the corresponding item within its inventory.</p></article></section><h2>Avoiding the Threat</h2><p>If the heroes are very careful moving around this room, they might avoid the fight with the spider entirely. They might also flee from the spider, moving past the encounter in this area without defeating it. In either case, the spider remains a threat every time the heroes pass through this chamber.</p><p>In some adventures, the situation changes if the players take too long or rest too often, but this adventure and its encounter remain the same no matter how long the players take in exploring this dungeon. Any creatures the heroes defeat remain dead or destroyed, and any creatures they avoid remain in the same place—potentially posing a danger if the heroes pass through that area again later!</p>"

On a success, they know the statue depicts Abadar, the god of wealth and civilization.</p><h2>The Puzzle</h2><p>The statue and the coins represent a puzzle. The challenge here is to identify which of the coins is fake. All of them look identical and they all weigh exactly the same, but the fake coin is worth less than the others. Explain to the players that when the heroes place coins in the statue’s hands, it will raise the hand that has a higher value. So if the heroes put four coins in each hand and the right hand contains the fake, the statue will raise the left hand. After two attempts, the statue asks the heroes to identify the fake.</p><p>If they fail to identify the fake coin, all the coins vanish and reappear in a random order atop the altar. If the coins are taken from the altar and not placed in the hands, they also vanish and the puzzle resets. Any real coins added to the puzzle vanish immediately, added to the vault in @UUID[.gz9x5HmzjSvvBLQp]. The heroes can try again as many times as they’d like. Failing to solve this puzzle doesn’t prevent the heroes from completing the adventure, but it does make the next combat a bit more challenging because of the trap in @UUID[.KWTky7M63NvVIVRz].</p><p>If they succeed, the real coins fall to the floor and the heroes can take them as treasure (each is worth 1 gp), while the fake coin turns to lead. In addition, the door to Area 10 slowly swings open (you can reveal this area by clicking on the secret door to open it), which gives the heroes access to Abadar’s treasure and allows them to adjust the traps in Area 11 to work in their favor.</p><p>When running this puzzle for the players, tell the players they must decide how they want to weigh coins numbered 1 through 9, and secretly pick which number represents the fake coin. If they fail to identify the fake coin and decide to try again, pick a new number (since the puzzle resets). The players might accidentally pick the fake coin without solving the puzzle, and that’s okay—adventurers get lucky sometimes! To make this puzzle simpler, you might want to provide props, like pieces of paper with a coin drawn on each one, numbered 1 through 9.</p><h3>The Solution</h3><p>The trick to solving the puzzle is to split the coins into three groups of three coins each. By placing one group of three in each hand and leaving the third group on the altar, the players can determine which group contains the fake coin. If one hand rises, the other hand contains the fake. If neither rises, then the fake is in the three coins that were left on the altar. The heroes then need to repeat this process with the group containing the fake, by placing one coin in each hand and leaving the third on the altar. If one hand rises, the coin in the other hand is the fake. If neither rises, the coin on the altar is the fake.</p><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>Not all challenges are dangerous! If the heroes solve the puzzle, award them each 80 XP.</p>"

This trap is active only if the heroes set the lever in @UUID[.gz9x5HmzjSvvBLQp] to “active.” Otherwise, it has no effect.</p><p>This trap affects part of the floor in this chamber. If the trap is active, the first creature to step on a floor tile in the white-outlined area triggers the trap—and it’s most likely the kobolds, who don’t realize the heroes have activated the trap! The trap shoots spears from the western wall, making a ranged Strike against the first creature in each row. Unlike the earlier trap, this trap has a Reset entry—if it’s not disabled, it resets after 1 minute and fires again the next time a creature moves in the outlined area.</p><h3>Kobold Snares</h3><p>The kobold trapmaster also has traps of her own- snares which she can set up as mobile traps. She sets them on the three squares located at the top of the stairs just to the east of the outlined area. You can use the @Actor[X1ZVzivrcAqbNDq2]{Spike Trap} actor to mark where they were placed. Once set up, these snares can be disarmed, but they can’t be reused—once they go off, they’re no longer a threat.</p><h3>Kobold Tactics</h3><p>Two kobold warriors are stationed here, along with a kobold trapmaster. All three kobolds have orders to make sure that no one reaches the kobold lair below.</p><p>The kobolds hear the door creak as it opens, so as soon as the heroes enter the room, the kobolds are ready to fight. Roll initiative (using Perception) for the kobold warriors and the trapmaster separately.</p><p>The two warriors start the combat at either side of the spiral staircase leading down, but they move to block the stairs at the start of their first turn. If the heroes activated the central spears trap using the control mechanism in Area 10, the kobolds set off that trap the moment they move into the outlined area to block the stairs. See Central Spears above for more information.</p><p>The kobold trapmaster stays where she is, spending all of her actions on the first round to lay down her last small spike trap (the other two are already down when the PCs enter the room). Once the final trap is placed, she uses her spears to attack the heroes from afar until they approach.</p></article></section><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>For overcoming the kobolds and the hazards in this room, give each hero 136 XP.</p><h2>Strange Jewelry</h2><p>After defeating the kobolds, the players can examine their fallen foes. The kobolds’ gear is listed in their stat blocks.</p><p>The kobold trapmaster is wearing a special necklace: a simple copper chain and a cracked piece of a large eggshell. The shell is ivory in color, but it has strange green veins running through it. This piece is only about 3 inches across, but the egg it came from must have been at least 2 feet wide. Even if the heroes take this piece back to town, no one can identify what sort of creature would lay such a massive egg, although Tamily speculates that it might have come from a giant turtle or another reptile. The heroes have the chance to learn more about this strange egg later in the dungeon.</p><h2>Going Down?</h2><p>After defeating the kobolds, the heroes can take their belongings (noted in each creature’s stat block). The heroes won’t find other treasure in the room, but there’s another exit: the spiral staircase in the back of the room descends even deeper into the earth.</p><p>This is a great time for the heroes to rest and regain their spells and Hit Points before pressing onward. You should remind them of this option and encourage them to head back up to Otari to report what they discovered. They can also use this time to sell any treasure they’ve found and purchase additional gear.</p><p>If the heroes report to Tamily Tanderveil about the scaly creatures creeping around the caverns, she’s shaken by the story of what they found underneath her fishery, and she implores the heroes to press on to put an end to this menace. She can identify the creatures as kobolds, small reptilian humanoids who have a fondness for traps and are often seen in the service of more powerful creatures. She also notes the amount of fish that has gone missing is far greater than what could have been eaten by a handful of kobolds. Tamily is worried that there’s something far hungrier beneath the city, and she shares her concern with the heroes.</p><p>If the players have had a particularly hard time with the adventure thus far, you can also use this opportunity to give them a bit of help. Tamily has a pair of @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.2RuepCemJhrpKKao]{Potions of Healing} stored away in case of emergency.

This gives it the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition, making it hard to hit with attacks. Whenever a hero attempts a spell attack roll or Strikes the rat, first ask the player to roll a flat check—a d20 roll with nothing added. If the die comes up with a 5 or higher, the hero can attack normally. If the roll is a 4 or less, the attack misses.</p><p>The smoke also chokes nearby creatures, forcing them to make fortitude saves to avoid choking.</p><h3>Persistent Damage</h3><p>Whenever the cinder rat hits a hero, that hero catches on fire! This deals persistent damage, a special type of damage that doesn’t happen right away. Instead, that hero takes [[/r 1d4[persistent,fire]]]{1d4 persistent fire damage} at the end of their turn (not the rat’s turn). The hero can then attempt a flat check (roll a d20 without adding anything) to see if the fire goes out—if the result is a 15 or higher, the flames are extinguished! If not, they’ll take the damage again at the end of their next turn (rolling 1d4 each time they take this damage), and then roll a new flat check. This happens at the end of every turn until the fire goes out.</p><p>There are other actions a hero can use to put out the fire. A hero can spend an action to pat out the flames. If they do, they can roll a flat check right away, before they take the damage, as described above. A hero might also think to go jump in the puddle of water.

If anyone touches it, a rush of wind fills the room, carrying a voice like a whisper. It says, “Call upon the wind to gain my blessing and soar through the sky.” This gives the heroes a special ability they can each use once within the next 24 hours. By spending 1 action to call upon the wind, that hero can fly for their next action, moving up to 40 feet. They have to end the movement on solid ground—if they don’t, they fall and take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance they fell.</p><p>If the heroes touch the earth orb, they hear grinding and grumbling, like boulders falling down a hill. In this cacophony, they hear another voice that says, \"Call upon the earth to gain its strength.\" The heroes gain a second ability they can each use once within the next 24 hours. If a hero spends an action to call upon the earth, all their melee Strikes deal 2 extra damage from a sudden surge of strength.

Since this is their home, they have a few other tricks they can use against the heroes. Use these throughout the fight to add variety and keep the players on their toes!</p><ul><li><strong>Bed Cover</strong>: A kobold in one of the sleeping chambers can spend 1 action to pull a sleeping mat off the floor and hide behind it. Doing so grants the kobold @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.other-effects.I9lfZUiCwMiGogVi] until they move or the start of their next turn.</li><li><strong>Food Fight</strong>: A kobold adjacent to the table can spend 1 action to pick up a scrap of rotting meat and throw it at a hero within 20 feet. This is a ranged Strike with a +5 attack modifier. If the Strike hits, it doesn’t deal damage. Instead, the hero is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} until they spend an action to clean the gross food off (no check needed).</li><li><p><strong>Oil Attack</strong>: The chest between two of the sleeping alcoves contains, among other things, three jars of slippery oil. A kobold must spend an action to open the chest before they can use the oil stored inside. Once the chest is open, a kobold next to it can spend 1 action to pick up and throw one of these jars of oil. This is a ranged Strike with a +5 attack modifier. If it hits a hero, that hero and the square they’re in are coated in slippery oil. On a miss, the oil covers the ground but not the hero. The kobold can also throw the oil at an empty square to make just the square slippery.<br />For the rest of the fight, a hero covered in oil has trouble moving. Each time they Stride, they must attempt a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:10]{Acrobatics Skill Check}. If they fail, they fall over and gain the prone condition instead of moving. The hero can Step, moving only 5 feet, without this check.<br />Anyone who moves through a square covered in oil must attempt a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:10]{Acrobatics Skill Check}.

Note that the heroes can earn additional XP depending on how they handle the last remaining kobold.</p><h2>Kobold Surrender</h2><p>When only one kobold remains, he immediately drops his weapons and surrenders to the heroes, begging and groveling for his life with a raspy, high-pitched voice. If the heroes spare the kobold, the creature promises to leave and never return, but he also quietly adds that he's willing to share secrets in exchange for gold.</p><p>The heroes have two options if they want to learn what the kobold knows. The first is to offer the kobold the gold he requests. If they give the kobold 10 gp, he shares what he knows about the boss, and if they give him 20 gp (total, not in addition), he also shares what he knows about the dragon.</p><p>But parting with their hard-earned wealth isn't the only solution. A hero can try to persuade the kobold to share what he knows by rolling a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:10]{Diplomacy} skill check, or they can bully the kobold with an @Check[type:intimidation|dc:10]{Intimidation} skill check. If a hero's total is 10 or more, they learn about the boss, and if their total is 20 or more, they learn about the dragon, too.</p><p><strong>About the Boss</strong>: The kobold says the following about their warren's boss.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">\"Boss Zolgran is the big leader of the mighty kobolds, and she has powerful magics to roast you alive! She's very angry all the time and demands much from her servants. Especially now that we have a powerful new friend!\"</p><p><strong>About the Dragon</strong>: The kobold says the following about the dragon.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative\">\"The friend is a dragon and a blessing from the gods, a sign that kobolds are destined to return to the surface and conquer the pathetic human town. As soon as the hatchling is all grown, we'll rise up to take what is ours!\"</p><h3>Experience Points</h3><p>If the heroes get the surrendered kobold to tell them about the boss, award each hero an additional 10 XP.

On the far side, a ledge overlooks the entry. Atop this ledge is an ornate stone throne that looks entirely out of place for this room.

With the precious treasure spirited away to the kobold hideout, the boss, Zolgran, has devised grand plans for her band now that it has a dragon patron. After raising the dragon, she hopes to use the beast to subjugate the entire region and finally reclaim the town of Otari for her people. Fortunately for the citizens of Otari, the baby dragon isn't fully grown yet—but the new hatchling is always hungry. That's why the band moved into these caverns, and why they've been raiding the Otari Fishery. Without a steady supply of food, the young dragon might turn to having kobolds for a snack!</p><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-other/icon-monster.webp\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Encounter</h2><p>@Actor[AleeS0IRqT4tUphB]{Zolgran, the Kobold Boss}, @Actor[rPaHIh0ICnTLnRO6]{2 Kobold Scouts}</p></header><article><h3>The Pit</h3><p>This pit in the center of this chamber is 20 feet deep.

Meanwhile, Zolgran assaults the groups using spells! The crafty kobold can cast spells just like a wizard. The spells she has prepared are listed in her stat block.</p><p>On her first turn, she spends all 3 actions to cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gKKqvLohtrSJj3BM]. This spell fires three shards of magical force, which she aims at the closest three heroes to deal 1d4+1 force damage each. If anyone gets past her guards, she casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.aIHY2DArKFweIrpf] on that hero, hoping to make them run away.

Each section of the adventure will teach new concepts as you need them, adding more and more to the game. Meanwhile, the other players each have an entire hero to roleplay as, learning how to use their abilities and how to succeed in the dangerous world that they find themselves exploring.</p><p>If you're the Game Master and you want to play with your friends right now, start with this adventure. It walks you and the other players through how to play, giving you a chance to learn together. If you don't want to play right away, the journal is a great starting place to learn more about being a GM.</p><h2>Choosing a Hero</h2><p>This adventure is designed to be played by four 1st-level heroes, but it will work for two or three heroes with only a few slight adjustments. Each player should pick one of the @UUID[JournalEntry.KIpNnMtah73eyPC8.JournalEntryPage.FM2SxBvhjufkiW44], or build their own hero following the steps in the @UUID[JournalEntry.KIpNnMtah73eyPC8.JournalEntryPage.RRxNZiD64dvvpWYt] handout.</p><p>If you are planning on running the game for Pathfinder Society organised play, you should also ensure that you have verified the information within the @UUID[.WpWULbveo4SMmMj5] handout.</p><p>Give the players 10-15 minutes to look over their character sheets so they can learn how their characters work. During this time, you should read through the introduction and @UUID[JournalEntry.qFSLpCM2cpRQWCR2.JournalEntryPage.UEuiUcrrPdr9eFqN] to get ready to run it. If you have extra time, you might also want to read the @UUID[JournalEntry.S1UnJk4t55aRFaCs.JournalEntryPage.ZFjG6Np42VRz5hFu] rules in preparation.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>When your players have chosen their heroes, you're ready to move on to the next step- setting up the adventure! The @UUID[JournalEntry.qFSLpCM2cpRQWCR2.JournalEntryPage.QFVMina0vPQXKUxC] page has all the information you need to share before your players dive into the dungeon proper.</p>"

The rules for running this adventure and chronicle sheet are available as a free download from Paizo, at the page linked above.</p><p>One of the restrictions on playing the adventure Menace Under Otari in Pathfinder Society, outlined in the \"Running the Adventure\" section of the Beginner Box Sanctioning guide, is that characters that are used in the adventure must be built using the more streamlined rules contained within the Beginner Box. These can be the pregenerated iconic characters or new heroes of your own creation.</p><p>Because the PF2E system on Foundry adapts the full version of the rules, we have at times simplified our rules references so that the advice and indications in these journals are consistent with both the mechanical implementation of the Pathfinder Second Edition ruleset by its Foundry development team and the rules outlined within the Beginner Box. The full variant rules that are used by Pathfinder Society for the Beginner Box are still available in your PDF.</p><p>Because of our changes, we have included additional guidance for those seeking to meet these requirements for Organised Play below.</p><h3>Playing With Pregenerated Characters</h3><p>The easiest option is to use pregenerated heroes, which Paizo recommends within their guidance as improving the immersion of players within the story. If you do so, please make sure that you have imported the Beginner Box version of the pregens from the \"Non-iconic Pregens\" compendium. These are the same character sheets which are included in the Beginner Box.</p><p>The iconic characters as they are presented in other Paizo products, which are contained in the \"Iconics\" compendium, would <em>not</em> qualify for Pathfinder Society credits.</p><h3>Creating Your Own Characters</h3><p>If you would like to make your own hero for Pathfinder Society play, we suggest consulting the rules as contained within the Beginner's Box PDF that was included with your purchase of this module to ensure that you are compliant. In addition, the Beginner Box Sanctioning guide linked above is a free document which will help you understand the full details of running this adventure in Pathfinder Society.</p><figure style=\"float:right\"><figcaption><br /></figcaption></figure><h3>Have Fun!</h3><p>Above all, we hope that, however you choose to play this adventure, you and your entire party have a wonderful time. That's why we chose to include the ability for the GM to decide which version of the adventure they want to play, and we strongly believe there is no wrong way to have fun.</p><p class=\"box-text narrative half\">Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p></article></section>"

Trapdoors in the tavern’s floor allow direct access to the river below for fishing, but foolhardy (or inebriated) patrons sometimes wrestle over these openings to determine who’s stronger and who’s getting wet. The building’s attic serves as the guildhall for Otari’s thieves’ guild, the Osprey Club—a function that’s perhaps the town’s worst-kept secret, as evidenced by the building’s very name.</p>"

If the heroes defeat the ghouls, they recover a strange idol the ghouls used to command the doppelgangers; the heroes can then use the idol to discover who else in town has been replaced.</p><figure class=\"right flipx\"><img class=\"noborder\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/portraits-bestiary/brine-shark.webp\" width=\"120\" /></figure><h3>Honor of Thieves</h3><p>At Crook’s Nook, a brine shark elemental leaps right into the tavern from one of the trapdoors. The heroes are on hand to defeat it, earning the gratitude of the Osprey Club. The thieves decide to thank the heroes by committing minor crimes against the heroes’ rivals (or anyone they perceive to be the heroes’ rivals) and give the heroes the “credit.” These gestures undoubtedly land the heroes in trouble with Lardus Longsaddle, and the heroes must clear up the confusion.</p><h3>Under the Thirsty Alpaca</h3><p>The Thirsty Alpaca’s collapse was inadvertently caused by a tribe of kobolds digging out tunnels beneath it while seeking treasures they believed were still hidden there. Their biggest mistake was allying with a gang of pugwampi gremlins, whose ill luck caused the collapse. The surviving kobolds try to keep townspeople away from the ruins with their spooky tricks and traps. The kobolds seek to re-excavate the passages and also fight against the surviving gremlins, who have decided to betray them! The PCs could try to negotiate a truce, evict both the kobolds and the gremlins, or find another solution.</p><h3>Wrin's Surprise Gift</h3><p>While meeting with the heroes, Wrin Sivinxi receives a large, unlabeled package. She opens it to reveal animated armor that runs amok. After the heroes stop it, Wrin asks them to track down the person who shipped it. Their investigation leads to a ship at the harbor, where an old enemy of Wrin’s is hiding out with her hobgoblin warrior bodyguards.</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/pf2e-beginner-box/assets/artwork-vignettes/harpy-ambush.webp\" width=\"650\" /></figure><h1>More Adventures in Otari</h1><p>The adventure in this book and the story seeds above aren’t the only adventures this town offers. The standalone Pathfinder Adventure Troubles in Otari continues the story begun here and brings heroes all the way to 5th level. The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path is a separate series of three linked adventures, starting with Ruins of Gauntlight, set in Otari and a dangerous dungeon just to the north. Of course, you can also invent adventures of your own!</p>"

You attack by rolling the 20-sided die (or d20 for short) and adding your attack bonus (which represents your skill at wielding a weapon). If the total is equal to or greater than the target's Armor Class (AC for short), then the attack is a hit and deals damage. Subtract the damage from the target's Hit Points (HP for short). To defeat them, you must reduce their HP <span style=\"font-family:var(--main-font)\">to 0 bor less.</span></p><p>On their turn, your enemy will likely attack you- you'll roll a d20 for them, add their attack bonus, and compare the result to your AC. If the enemy reduces you to 0 HP or less, you die.</p><p>Finally, if your attack roll exceeds the enemy's AC by 10 or more, it's a critical hit and you deal double damage (roll once, and double the result). You also score a critical hit against the enemy if the result of the die roll shows a \"20\" on the die. When the enemy attacks you, it can score a critical hit only if the die roll is a 20.</p><h3>Rounds and Actions</h3><p>Combat occurs in rounds. In each round, both you and the enemy take turns, and on each turn, you can use 3 actions. Once you have used your actions, it's the enemy's turn. After it uses 3 actions, it's your turn again. This repeats until one side is defeated. Actions are denoted by the action symbol (<span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span>).</p><p>Although you can attack three times in one turn, each time you attack in a single round, each subsequent attack becomes less accurate. For instance, your first Shortsword attack is rolled with a +7 bonus, but your second only has +2.</p>"
