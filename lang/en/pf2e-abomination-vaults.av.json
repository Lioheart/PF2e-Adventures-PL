                            "text": "<aside class=\"av-float-block\"><h3>From the Beginner Box</h3><p>If you started the heroes' careers with the Pathfinder Beginner Box and the adventure \"Menace Under Otari,\" your heroes already know about Otari. They're also already 2nd level! You don't need to make any adjustments to this adventure, as 2nd level characters can begin it without any trouble. Don't allow them to level up to 3rd level until they've substantially cleared the dangers in both of the upper two dungeon levels.</p></aside><h2>Using Experience Points</h2><p>While each level of the @UUID[JournalEntry.YbOS6pQRxoWI0Q56.JournalEntryPage.RBY8Uu8FDdAjmE4K] is built with the assumption of a group of heroes at a particular character level, each has more than enough encounters for a party to level up. Part of the joy of a large dungeon crawl is the exploration of every nook and cranny, and a party who faces every encounter might gain enough experience points to reach higher levels well before the end of this Adventure Path- and that's fine! Some later encounters challenge a high-level party well enough, even if the heroes have to retreat, rest, and recover less often.</p><p>The dungeon provides lots of freedom to explore, particularly in the middle levels. Let the players gauge whether their characters are in over their heads and retreat (or flee!) if the situation demands it. When the heroes face harder-than-expected challenges for their current level, they earn more XP, and when they face easier-than-expected ones, they earn less. This keeps their progression on roughly the same track. That said, if you want a slower-paced game, Abomination Vaults works well with a slow Advancement Speed (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 509).</p><h2>Using Milestones</h2><p>Story-based progression can be tricky for a giant dungeon crawl since the heroes can move between levels through multiple routes. If you prefer story-based progression, rather than automatically allowing the heroes to level up simply because they quickly reached a lower dungeon level, consider requiring them to complete specific milestones to level up, as detailed in the \"advancement\" section in @UUID[.8aIgvvxLjsYxB1LS].</p>"

These effects are marked by special callout boxes, such as the example below.</p> <section class=\"box-text investigation\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/exploration/lens.webp\" width=\"100\" /> <h2>Exploration</h2> <p>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Search} @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.EwgTZBWsc8qKaViP]{Investigate}</p> </header> <article> <h3>Searching the Room</h3> <p>A hero that succeeds at a @Check[type:perception|dc:18|traits:action:search]{Perception} check while searching the room finds a secret door behind the tapestry hanging on the north wall.</p> <h3>Investigating the Mosaic</h3> <p>A @Check[type:society|dc:20|traits:action:decipher-writing]{Society} check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.d9gbpiQjChYDYA2L]{Decipher Writing} reveals that the mysterious script on the northern wall is an old Elvish proverb.</p> </article> </section> <h3>Actions</h3> <p>In the exploration callout boxes, the relevant actions you need to look out for will be listed in the header. For example, in this case, we know that if any of our players are using @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Search} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.EwgTZBWsc8qKaViP]{Investigate}, they may learn additional information. These are the most common two exploration activities, but others, such as @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.kV3XM0YJeS2KCSOb]{Scout} or @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.IE2nThCmoyhQA0Jn]{Avoid Notice}, will also be useful. Of course, you should feel free to reward your players with information, secret doors, or treasure even if they aren't doing the specific exploration activity that's listed!</p> <p>As you've probably already noticed, as well as being a reference for which activities to look out for, you can also click on these links to see the full rules text of that exploration activity.</p> <h3>Checks</h3> <p>Sometimes these exploration activities will require a roll, as you can see in the above section. Throughout the adventure, most skill checks and saving throws will be presented in this format. By pressing the speech bubble icon next to the button, you can print it to chat, allowing your players to simply click it (with their token selected!) to roll a check. This is quite optional but can be a handy way to tell degrees of success at a glance.</p> <p>Sometimes, however a character who searches a room will find something as long as they simply spend the time to do so.</p>"

Links which go directly to items, like the longsword above, can simply be dragged right from the journal onto a player's character sheet. In other cases, especially if there are a great number of different items in one place, we will provide loot actors, like the Waterlogged Chest above. These have tokens which are placed on the scene, hidden by default. They can contain a number of items, and giving these items to your players is as simple as revealing the token. They will be able to open the loot sheet and take items directly from it by dragging them into their inventories.</p><h3>Coin as treasure</h3><p>Coins are the only form of treasure which won't be linked to in journals. This is because there is already an easy way for your players to add coin to their sheets- through the \"add currency\" function in their inventories.</p><h3>Modifying Treasure</h3><p>If you plan to modify the items your players will find, or if you're interested in getting an idea of the sorts of items that they may be able to get their hands on, you can look at the list below. This lists all of the permanent and consumable magic items from each chapter, not including treasure items which are only useful in trade. Of course, your players probably won't find every piece of treasure the Abomination Vaults have to offer!</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article><h3>Chapter 1 Treasure:</h3><ul><li>+1

While the playlists have been carefully organized in the interest of making them intuitive for use, as with all aspects of running an adventure, preparation is key.</p><p>To provide the best audio experience for your players, it is important to be familiar with the types of playlists and sounds at your disposal.</p><h2>Simultaneous Music and Ambience</h2><p>We did not provide music or pre-set soundscapes for the average combat, but there are musical atmospheres pre-configured for particular map regions. These can be identified with reasonable ease by matching the name to the journal entry for an area. While these entries are not named to match exactly, it should be clear which is which.</p><p>Most scenes have several key musical themes tied with ambience tracks, each balanced carefully and set to play simultaneously in order to build the soundscape for that area.</p><p>If you find the music or a soundscape is becoming repetitive, the playlist folder \"All Floors\" contains music and ambiences you can use to bring a different feeling to an area.</p><h3>Recurring Themes</h3><p>The playlists provided include, and reuse, a number of recurring themes to let you build auditory reminders for your players. For example, whenever a scene involves Belcorra Haruvex, one of her golems, or a particularly potent remnant of her past, a playlist will begin with \"Belcorra Warning\". In places where the essence of Nhimbaloth has had an effect, the audio track \"What Do We Say to the Empty Death\" has likely been left as an ambient sound source on the scene - albeit quiet enough that only the most attentive player should notice it. Throughout the first four floors, Volluk's theme: The Worms March (or Waltz of the Worms) has been woven into the playlists to represent his involvement in that particular sideplot. Making liberal (but subtle) use of tracks like these will help elicit a response in your players when they reach an inevitable combat where the theme is used as they face their foe.</p><section class=\"box-text fvtt\"><header><img src=\"icons/vtt-512.png\" width=\"100\" /><h2>Ambient Sound Sources</h2><p><a class=\"entity-link\" href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/ambient-sound/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em class=\"fas fa-book\"> </em>Knowledge Base: Ambient Sounds</a></p></header><article><p>Throughout the adventure, each scene has at least two pre-placed ambient sound sources. Usually centered on the Gauntlight Tower. Ambient sound sources give your players audio clues in proximity to their tokens, and it is important as a GM to know when they will be experiencing those sounds. Before your sessions start, take a moment and familiarize yourself with the sounds your players may experience by checking the Ambient Sound Controls.</p><p>You can stop an ambient sound source from emanating its sound by right clicking it from the sound layer at any time.</p></article></section><h2>Using Combat Music</h2><p>While only a few combat audio tracks have been provided for normal combat encounters, there is also a list of 'major encounter' music tracks which can be leveraged in more serious fights. While a number of these have been chosen for specific encounters, we encourage you to create your own combat soundscapes with the tools available. However, use some caution---due to the use of recurring themes as mentioned above, overexposure to particular tracks may have a negative effect on the sound experience for the adventure. Always know what your players are going to hear (and how loudly) before you play it.</p><h2>Using Ambient Silence</h2><p>A few key places use playlists that do not come coupled with music, by design. These are meant to give a GM opportunity to use the silence as a cue of danger in and of itself. To maximize impact, you are encouraged to use the pause button on a playlist to bring your players warning of an imminent danger, or a feeling of being watched. </p><p>In the depths of the Abomination Vaults, there are dangers around every corner and sometimes a well placed silence can be enough to make your players consider turning back.</p>"

As a result, everyone who grows up in Otari has a healthy mix of fear, respect, and curiosity for the old ruins out in Fogfen and the strange lighthouse that stands at the swamp's heart. As they grow older, townsfolk learn what's more often accepted as truth: that the heroic founders of Otari had slain the wicked sorcerer Belcorra many years ago. For a time, thrill-seekers explored the ruins around the lighthouse called <em>Gauntlight</em>, but today, common knowledge holds that the place has become a haven for pests—no longer a source of active danger or significant treasure after being completely picked over. Nearly 500 years has passed since Belcorra's defeat after all, and in that time, she has only posed a menace to Otari through sinister rhymes.</p><p>Or so the citizens of Otari believe.</p><p>While many old legends about Belcorra are true (she did practice cannibalism, for example, but didn't limit her diet to foolish children), the belief that she's no longer a danger is false. Two years ago, on the 500th anniversary of the most significant event of her life- her family's exile from Absalom for abhorrent rites- Belcorra's spiteful ghost awoke deep beneath Gauntlight Keep. The lighthouse and surrounding ruins presented only the highest level of a vast complex Belcorra had stocked with malicious and malignant creatures: her Abomination Vaults. Belcorra's spite has festered in the intervening centuries, and she hungers for revenge, not only against Absalom for destroying her family, but also the town of Otari and its founders- the heroes who killed her. Belcorra bides her time while she rebuilds, reenergizing the dread Gauntlight and reasserting her dominance over the feral and forgotten monsters of the Abomination Vaults!</p><h2>Belcorra's History</h2><p>The ghost sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex is the primary villain of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. The story behind her spiteful rage is one of exile and loss.</p><p>The Haruvex family tree both sprawls and surges with sorcery. The family's strongest bloodlines have an aberrant strain, which provides family prestige as well as sorcerous power. Generations of Haruvexes married within the family to strengthen this lineage, and the most powerful Haruvexes lived in Absalom 500 years ago. These Absalom Haruvexes made secret obeisance to the Outer Gods for great wealth and greater power. But none in the family approached the power of their youngest scion, Belcorra Haruvex. Belcorra had been told, every day for as long as she could remember, that she was the harbinger of Nhimbaloth, the Empty Death, and that she was her family's greatest hope for power and prosperity.</p><p>The Haruvexes enacted abhorrent rites in their worship, including bloody sacrifices, and the authorities eventually caught wind of their crimes. The Haruvexes were finally driven from the Isle of Kortos in 4219 ar, forced to leave their estates and luxuries behind. Belcorra was only 6 years old at the time, but as she grew, her rage at losing her home solidified into an overwhelming hatred of Absalom and everyone in it.</p><p>Most of the exiled Haruvexes died in poverty, but Belcorra grew strong and proud. At 17, she interpreted visions from Nhimbaloth that led her back to the Isle of Kortos to plan her revenge. Far above a subterranean shrine to Nhimbaloth called the Empty Vault, in a lonely stretch of wooded coast a few dozen miles from Absalom, Belcorra erected a magical lighthouse and called it @UUID[JournalEntry.YbOS6pQRxoWI0Q56.JournalEntryPage.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX]. She dug deep beneath it to reach the shrine she had seen in her visions, and while she worked, she began to plan her revenge. She would draw subterranean monsters and violent beasts into her secret dungeons- which she called the Abomination Vaults- and use <em>Gauntlight</em>'s magic to send them into Absalom to wreak havoc. She enacted the first part of her plan, expanding the Abomination Vaults and raising a defensible keep around the lighthouse. She leveraged family acquaintances to acquire powerful retainers and champions to lead her monstrous forces.</p><p>Belcorra was still stocking her Abomination Vaults with aberrations when rumors of her villainy reached Absalom. The @UUID[.Gx2mnbeUctXU7XUN], a group of heroes headquartered in Absalom, set out from the city to confront and vanquish her. The Roseguard faced Belcorra within Gauntlight Keep and killed her there. One of the four members of the Roseguard, a rogue named Otari Ilvashti, died in this fight. Grieving their lost friend, the Roseguard left, sealed up the keep, founded what would become the town of Otari, and retired there. They never knew of the keep’s lower levels or the many creatures still remaining within them.</p><h2>Spiteful Master of the Abomination Vaults</h2><p>Belcorra’s spirit didn’t rest peacefully. Consumed by rage and empowered by Nhimbaloth, she arose as a powerful ghost 500 years after her family’s exile from Absalom, the event that so dramatically altered her life. Belcorra now lurks in the deepest levels of the Abomination Vaults, plotting her revenge against Absalom and the heroes who vanquished her. The Roseguard are long dead, but the town they founded remains, and the icons representing their adventuring careers now have the power to penetrate Belcorra’s protections.</p><p>At first, no one in Otari realizes the danger Belcorra poses. Her machinations and her monsters are well out of sight. But before she moves against Absalom, she intends to use her <em>Gauntlight</em> against Otari—the town built by the adventurers who killed her five centuries before. Only Otari’s newest heroes can prevent Belcorra’s vengeance and put her spirit to rest.</p>"

As Carman grew older, he first worked at Otari's blacksmith's shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.5yYs7JNliPnSYLhp], and later won the shop in a lucky wager against the prior owner. Yet he couldn't forget his family's sword. Officially, the Menhemes family claimed ownership over Vol's ancient blade but \"allowed\" it to stay in the library in an act of purported generosity that Carman found offensive.</p><p>The summer his parents were waylaid and slain by bandits on the road from Absalom, Carman became a broken man. His work at the smithy became erratic, and he stopped relaxing with his friends and helping his community. With no other direction, Carman squandered his inheritance, spending the money on entertainment, fine clothes, and rare whiskey. He started spending more time gambling and drinking at the @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.sdNti6BHkPTeO5fC] than he did at his smithy. Eventually the inheritance money ran out, and Carman was faced with a sizable debt. Several owed favors later, he started grifting travelers or hustling them at the knife-throwing board at the Crook's Nook. But his vices still outpaced his earnings from petty cons, and soon he took to outright thievery under Yinyasmera's tutelage. The \"Ace of Blades\" is the moniker given to the best knife thrower in the Crook's Nook, and Carman Rajani has held that title for so long that it's become his nickname among fellow members of the Osprey Club.</p><h3>Mayoral Candidacy</h3><p>Within a few years, Carman had settled into his new life, working as a smith during the day, carousing at the Crook's Nook at night, and occasionally engaging in some petty larceny when his coin purse started to get light. When he heard rumors that people thought he was wasting his life, though, it stung his pride. He resolved to run for mayor against Oseph, to show the whole town that his family was the equal of the Menhemes family.</p><p>Everyone thought Carman's candidacy was a joke. The second time he ran, his platform became nothing more than sharp personal attacks against the Menhemes family; the townspeople felt the joke had gone sour and considered it a waste of their time. He met their jibes with violence, getting into brawls to prove he was the better man. The third time he ran for office, he actually put in effort to help the community. Though he lost by much smaller margin, he took the loss as proof that kindness can't get you any further than your fists can. The fourth time, he tried to force a successful campaign with open bribes and blackmail.</p><p>Oseph won by a landslide, showing up on Election Day wearing the Cooperative Blade as part of his celebratory regalia. Carman finally decided that the magic sword must be the key to his success. Everyone in town knew it brought Otari good luck, so whoever held the sword had the town in their pocket. As Vol's heir, he deserved the sword. He begged Oseph to sell the weapon, but Oseph suspected it was some new scheme- or worse, connected to one of Carman's rumored crimes or debts- and countered with delays, excuses, and price increases.</p><p>Finally, Carman decided he'd had enough. If he wanted his family's sword back, he'd have to take it.</p>"

Once Jafaki realizes the heroes are powerful enough to face them directly, the seugathi understands that they would make excellent candidates for experimentation. Unfortunately for Jafaki, this realization probably comes too late.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Belcorra first spotted Jafaki and several other seugathis slithering through the Darklands while she was building the Abomination Vaults. They expressed an eagerness to serve her and advance their own experiments. Belcorra knew the seugathis could improve her forces, as well as expand. She tasked them with building her a perfect soldier, then making armies of them to conquer Absalom. Knowing that perfection was a high price to ask, Belcorra funneled all the resources she could to the seugathis. The seugathis pursued not one research path but many, including fleshwarping, monster breeding, and even dabbling in magical constructs. Belcorra didn’t mind this broad experimentation, as nearly all of it provided her with useful monsters for her growing army. She passed along the seugathis’ innovations to other alchemists and mages who could duplicate the work.</p><h3>After Belcorra</h3><p>When the Roseguard defeated Belcorra, the seugathis nevertheless continued pursuing their objective. Their initial obstacle was a bone devil named Tarkannah. Tarkannah deemed that ongoing duty to Belcorra—to whom the bone devil remained loyal even after her death—meant taking a firmer hand in overseeing the seugathis. Tarkannah tried to constrain and direct the seugathis’ sprawling research. Rather than comply with these unwelcome demands, the seugathis rebelled; Jafaki ambushed and killed Tarkannah and seized control of the laboratories level.</p><p>This assault started a brief war between the devils and the seugathis. For months the two sides fought, but @UUID[.t9SSGAP5pW2NpkWh] soon discovered the seugathis weren’t really interested in expanding their holdings, only defending the territory they had. The two sides settled in an uneasy truce on their respective levels of the vaults. These front lines aren’t absolute; Urevian is happy to permit potential “raw materials” to pass through the prison, and the seugathis’ cast-off creatures often find their way into the devil’s gradually increasing forces.</p><figure class=\"left\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/items/fleshforged-soldier.webp\" width=\"210\" /></figure><p>Jafaki has little concern for the army growing on the level below. The seugathis don’t bother with the imp and zebub spies that occasionally pass through the laboratories, but Jafaki and their colleagues can make marching through with a large army costly or even impossible. Jafaki plans to permit free passage only in exchange for additional concessions to bolster their ongoing experiments, even though Urevian is certain to balk at the cost.</p><h3>Jafaki's Obsession</h3><p>Jafaki's research has seemed to drift over the years through various abhorrent sciences: fleshwarping, reanimation of the dead, selective breeding, or even golem creation. Yet they remain as focused on their goal of creating the perfect soldier as they were when they spoke to Belcorra all those years ago.</p><p>That word has driven Jafaki for centuries. Good soldiers? They’ve created those, and all have died by the dozens or hundreds in the arena. Great soldiers? Some of Jafaki's finest works have been nearly unstoppable. But “nearly” is not “perfect.” Jafaki will pursue perfection for as long as it takes.</p>"

Always looking to sweeten a deal, Urevian further offered to train Belcorra’s armies and lead her invasion of Absalom—for a price. Urevian knew that Vol Rajani, legendary Roseguard swordswoman and exiled royalty from Nidal, lived in Absalom. The Rajani family has, for reasons even Urevian doesn’t know, special value to certain parties in Hell. In exchange for Urevian’s aid, Belcorra guaranteed him Rajani’s soul.</p><p>When the Roseguard attacked Gauntlight, bringing the soul right to Belcorra’s doorstep, Urevian was in Hell, committing Rajani’s soul to a much more powerful entity—even though he didn’t yet have it. By the time he returned, the Roseguard had prevailed with Belcorra slain. The sorcerer couldn’t fulfill her end of the bargain, trapping Urevian in the interminable process of preparing a surface invasion that would gain him nothing. Worse, he didn’t dare return to Hell without the Rajani soul, and his agreement forbid him from capturing the soul directly or through his infernal proxies, as Belcorra was intended to deliver it. Urevian was trapped.</p><p>Now that Belcorra has returned, Urevian’s agreement with her can be fulfilled. He plans to train her armies and invade the surface, starting with Otari; his spying has informed him that Carman Rajani, whose soul can also fulfill his contract, lives there. Urevian has fully mobilized his devils to train the fleshwarps who’ve come into his realm. Belcorra placed several horrible monsters in stasis, though Urevian doesn’t yet know how to reliably free them and has made that discovery his next priority.</p><h3>Uneasy Allies</h3><p>Although the devils can use dimension door to reach the surface quickly, Urevian’s other troops need physical access, which required him to approach the seugathi @UUID[.qrb0F1AQ3iIR7Xni] about allowing them through the laboratories. Jafaki feared another diabolic ruse—a reasonable assumption given the seugathis’ past relations with Urevian—and agreed on one condition: Urevian must allow the seugathis to “personally inspect” all infernal forces and make “upgrades and improvements.” Urevian knew this ploy was for Jafaki to get their tentacles on endless research subjects and that the fleshwarper would never sign off on any troops. Urevian is ready to wash his hands of this entire arrangement, but alas, he has a contract.</p>"

The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path assumes that Wrin is a contact the heroes share in common, so when she notices a strange buildup of eerie light atop distant Gauntlight, it’s natural for her to confide her fears in the heroes.</p><p>As the campaign progresses, Wrin can help the heroes in other ways, such as by performing astrology readings for the heroes to aid them in their explorations. While she won’t give her store’s wares away for free, her establishment is the best place to buy and sell the odd magical treasures heroes tend to find and crave. Wrin can also introduce the heroes to the wonders of the spirit world—her tutelage unlocks the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.mkp6lhBbTASEmKwY] archetype. Despite the claustrophobia she suffers, if the heroes find themselves in over their head in the Abomination Vaults, you can have Wrin face her fears to brave the dungeon and mount a rescue. Of course, you shouldn’t use Wrin in this capacity except as a last resort to keep the campaign from reaching an untimely end!</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Wrin Sivinxi grew up in the small village of Glitterbough in Kyonin, but a traveler wouldn’t find her hometown if they were to visit that nation today, for Glitterbough was destroyed 10 years ago by demons in the service of Treerazer. Despite the loss of her hometown, Wrin feels no sadness or despair about the event, for none perished in Glitterbough’s fall. In the days before the demon army’s attack, Wrin had a vision of the disaster. She warned her parents and neighbors, and their trust in her visions gave the town the time it needed to relocate everyone in the village to safety. When the demons came, they found Glitterbough deserted, and when they burned it in frustration, they suffered greatly from the magical traps the elves had left behind to greet them.</p><p>When she came of age a few years later, Wrin left her parents and friends, eager to find her own place in the world. As she traveled, she trusted in her visions and her unusual faith in a pantheon of deities associated with space and time she refers to as the Cosmic Caravan, looking to the nightly stars to make decisions for tomorrow. Her knack for finding lost things and gathering strange treasures made establishing her own curio shop an obvious choice, and it wasn’t by chance that she decided to set up that shop in Otari—it was simply the port she’d arrived at when her capacity to carry her collection finally outweighed its portability.</p><p>She opened her shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.jlb4fsKQC57ZjNQ7], four years ago. In that time, she has become part of the community, even if many of its citizens regard her as a good-natured eccentric. Sales of the strange and bizarre aren’t brisk in the small town, but that’s no matter to Wrin—she’s patient and has enjoyed her time in Otari so far. One day, she hopes to make enough money to fund a trip west, for she has heard tell of an abandoned observatory in the small town of Crookcove on Ravounel’s southwestern coast that she hopes to purchase and transform into a temple devoted to the Cosmic Caravan. But for the time being, she’s content to stay in Otari and sleep under the stars.</p><p>Wrin’s tiefling ancestry is impossible to miss, and it’s something she long ago decided to embrace. Eyes devoid of pupils, small ram horns curling around her elven ears, a thin tail, and fingertips that sparkle with motes of glittering lights leave no doubt that she’s touched by supernatural forces. Yet, her quick smile and welcoming attitude have always helped her to secure friendships during her travels.</p>"

His companions assumed he was pulverized, but Otari had fallen into a level beneath Gauntlight Keep that none of the Roseguard knew existed. Otari desperately wanted to escape to the surface and share his discovery, but Belcorra’s minions forced him to flee ever deeper into the vaults, until nally he was cornered in a dead-end cave by an immense otyugh that left him trapped and suffering from filth fever.

His fated confrontation with the heroes is necessary because he holds the Emerald Fulcrum Lens and refuses to give it up as long as he lives, as it symbolizes the leadership of his cult. Khurfel’s vision of falling at the heroes’ hands doesn’t inspire fear—it inspires fury, and he fights against his prophesized enemies as long as breath remains in his body.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Khurfel saw his first blood vision as a child, after his first taste of an enemy’s blood. Not every urdefhan has blood visions; those who do tend to keep them quiet, for those who experience them are seen as irrational or untrustworthy. Such visions always relay great apocalypses, perhaps connected to daemons and urdefhans’ lust for great death, but they’re nonsensical and rarely come true. Yet, like all urdefhans subjected to blood visions, Khurfel was absolutely convinced of his vision’s veracity, its outcome terrifying him. He saw the end of his cult, the urdefhans in the Abomination Vaults once sworn to Belcorra but who had mostly forgotten their oaths. He saw that this end would come while he ruled and that he was powerless to stop it. He would be the last war champion.</p><p>Of course, Khurfel kept his visions secret. If the rest of his cult knew of them, his life would be forfeit— but that wasn’t the real reason he denied them. His blood boiled at the revelation. He was the chosen of Abaddon. He would indeed rise to war champion, but he would fight these fevered nightmares. They were another enemy to be vanquished.</p><p>Khurfel’s rise was swift. He was large, strong, and fearsome. When he led his first war band, he achieved victory and slaughter, and when he partook in his enemies’ blood, the haunting visions waned. Within a few years, Khurfel became the youngest war champion in his cult’s history. He swore to defend their symbol of leadership, the Emerald Fulcrum Lens carried by generations of war champions. That’s when Khurfel’s troubles began.</p><p>It’s one thing to lead comrades into battle. Everything not urdefhan is prey. Fighting was simple and visceral. It focused Khurfel’s mind, and it exhilarated him. But being a leader, he learned, was far more nuanced. He had to juggle the jealousies, ambitions, and problems of everyone in his cult, an aspect of his position that he found tiring and dull. Worse still, his blood visions resumed. The Ghost Queen Belcorra returned to tell his cult to be ready, for they would soon have worlds of slaughter when she finished with her plans. His fellow urdefhans cheered at this promise, but Khurfel’s visions dampened his joy.</p><p>His visions showed him that hunting the drow leader, Larathols, would be the first step toward his cult’s demise. However, Larathols provoked Khurfel with his cautious explorations of the great lake the urdefhans claimed as their own. Larathols sought secrets in the forbidden vault—the one the urdefhans had been told long ago that no one should enter. Hungry for another fight and believing he could overcome his visions, Khurfel swam to an island on the lake and there killed Larathols and his daughter. He drank of the drow’s blood and threw the body into the lake so monsters could rip it apart. He had vanquished his foes. The victory was glorious, and his people screamed his name in triumph. Larathols’s blood was invigorating. What urdefhan doesn’t want these things? It’s every urdefhan’s right to bring death and destruction into the world.</p><p>But Khurfel’s blood visions now manifest more frequently, showing strangers who threaten him and drow working against him. He has called upon his cult’s tormentors and blood mages to summon more daemons and strengthen their defenses, but the visions persist. Khurfel is uneasy, and his doubt feels like weakness. The only way to solve a problem is to destroy it utterly—what his people have always done. Still the visions come, and Khurfel is powerless to stop them.</p>"

Her father, a wise and prudent man named Larathols, had ruled the settlement for many centuries. She loved her father, not only because he was a decent man, but because he granted Quara the freedom to forge her own path. She loved the swagger and fearlessness of Yldaris’s shootists and grew up fascinated by their tall tales and the way they reveled in their exploits.</p><p>Larathols saw no reason not to indulge his youngest daughter’s aspirations. He was already preparing Quara’s older sister, Galuna, to lead Yldaris when the time came, which Quara always imagined as many centuries in the future. In the meantime, she honed her skills with the shootists. It didn’t take long for her to start inspiring stories herself and to collect the scars that go with them—the most severe of which came from a run-in with a gug, against which she ultimately prevailed. She wore the creature’s pelt for years until it grew too tattered to be practical.</p><p>Quara’s carefree life changed after her father’s and sister’s deaths. At the time, she was carousing in Lozardyn and delighting in its residents’ larger-than-life rumors about her. Larathols decided to raid one of Belcorra’s secret storehouses to gain more information about the magical lens the sorcerer had entrusted to Larathols’s father many years ago. Galuna had gone with him, and Khurfel, war champion of the nearby urdefhans, ambushed and killed the pair. Quara was immediately called back to Yldaris. As the most senior of the shootists and Larathols’s daughter, she was expected to assume leadership of the outpost.</p><p>Quara never knew much about Belcorra or about the secret mission that cost her father and sister their lives. Belcorra had visited Yldaris years before Quara’s birth and made a deal with her grandfather, the vague details of which Quara heard only through rumors. She knew her grandfather played a dangerous game with Belcorra, promising forces that he couldn’t deliver and keeping the arrangement secret from Lozardyn’s rulers.</p><p>When the sorcerer suddenly disappeared—killed at the hands of surface dwellers, rumor said—the problem seemed to have sorted itself out.</p><h3>Visit from a Forgotten Friend</h3><p>Belcorra arrived in Yldaris shortly after Quara came home, imperiously demanding that Quara swear fealty just as her grandfather had. Never one to be much bound by promises anyway, Quara glibly swore to support the ghost because it seemed like the safest course of action.</p><p>Quara immediately consulted with Yldaris’s enigmatic cavern seers and her father’s closest allies to find out what had happened to him. She learned a little bit about her father’s last days, where he had gone and why, and that he’d taken something called the Ochre Fulcrum Lens that Belcorra had entrusted to Quara’s grandfather five centuries earlier. Belcorra hadn’t mentioned the lens when she appeared before Quara—perhaps assuming it was languishing in some Yldaris treasure vault—but Quara deduced the lens’s critical importance.</p><p>The responsibility of administering Yldaris has changed Quara. Her wild days have ended; she rarely drinks and never to excess. However, her freewheeling time as a shootist taught her the dangers of their outpost. She boasts less and has become more circumspect, having learned the lessons of true leadership. Her people love her for it. Quara would be shocked to hear it, but she’s just as well-regarded a leader as Larathols ever was.</p>"

Yet, as with most rivers, predators lurk along these perilous banks. Night hags, astradaemons, devourers, and worse stalk the River, eager to pluck souls free and feed on them. Dread Nhimbaloth, the Empty Death, doesn’t deign to hunt the shores of the River of Souls alongside these predators—she instead feeds upon the predators themselves, reveling in consuming souls already being digested in the gullets of those who would deem themselves the apex hunters of the dead.</p><p>Nhimbaloth uses the shores of the River of Souls to manifest upon the universe’s countless worlds, but she can’t just do so whenever she wills it. Before the Empty Death can manifest within a world, it must first endure a cataclysm so vast that the outflow of the dead into the River of Souls weakens the boundaries between life and death. When such massive casualties sufficiently thin these borders, she can drift in through the cracks and stain what she finds. The resulting blurring between the River of Souls and its shore is metaphysically akin to the muddied boundary of a swamp. It’s no coincidence that when Nhimbaloth emerges into a world, she chooses to dwell in its remote swamplands. Nhimbaloth isn’t a glutton—she’s endlessly patient and can linger on a world for centuries before being noticed.</p><p>More often, her presence in an isolated swampland simply festers, turning a region of natural beauty into a dangerous fen that draws all manner of monsters to its fetid heart. Such lands call to will-o’-wisps; for these feeders of fears, the ruin wrought by the Empty Death is like a fine wine of unparalleled vintage. In time, many of these wisps realize the truth of the influence in their chosen haunts, and in most cases, these ravenous aberrations become Empty Death’s most fervent worshippers.</p><figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/nhimbaloth.webp\" width=\"300\" /></figure><h1>Personification and Realm</h1><p>While Dread Nhimbaloth has no physical body of her own, she has been known to manifest a perceivable shape under the perfect conditions, growing visible after consuming a huge quantity of souls the way an empty glass’s contours becomes more defined once filled with liquid. In this form, Nhimbaloth appears as a twisting, melted mass of glistening blue fluid with eyes the shape of yellow four-pointed stars and a tangle of translucent tentacles extending in every direction. The tentacles’ tips split into seven smaller tendrils, and where these “hands” touch the world, they leave her mark behind—a ring of seven strange divots where vegetation refuses to grow, stone becomes chalky, and flesh festers as if it had forgotten how to heal. The position of the stars in the sky, the number of dead trapped within the swamp, and the time of year all seem to play a part in determining when this shadow of what might have once been Nhimbaloth’s body can appear, as does the presence of her cultists, but the manifestation rarely persists for long. Always, the manifestation ends in a sudden consumption from within when the Empty Death retreats to her domain, leaving behind a dead swampland of toxic waters and mindless undeath.</p><p>This form often appears in illustrations that depict the Empty Death, though Nhimbaloth is also portrayed as a ghostly human woman with a single yellow eye in the shape of a four-pointed star filling her otherwise blank face, and a long, writhing mane of ghostly, seven-fingered tentacles wraps around her nearly skeletal body in a smoky shroud. This version of her is surely the product of an artist’s nightmare, yet cults have adopted it as their own.</p><p>Nhimbaloth’s realm is a twofold domain. She uses the banks of the River of Souls as a hunting ground and a highway to travel from world to world, but supposedly dwells on a distant, dead planet. The name of this domain has been lost to time; the faithful of Nhimbaloth refer to it in whispers only as Voidbracken. Here, an ancient battle between Nhimbaloth and another power took place (most myths suggest her foe was Pharasma) that resulted in the destruction of the Empty Death’s body. This conflict didn’t result in her death, however, and her cult fondly views the event as an evolution—for without a body, she could now come and go as she pleased along the shores of the River of Souls. Voidbracken spins still in the Dark Tapestry, wandering aimlessly through the universe but driven always by Nhimbaloth’s will, and when it draws near an inhabited system, the souls of the living are drawn from their mortal shells in a cataclysm referred to in rare surviving accounts as the Deadtide. According to certain passages scribed in ancient texts like the Necronomicon, many of the Great Old Ones and Outer Gods must wait for the stars to align just right to manifest. This is quite literally true in Nhimbaloth’s case. Eventually, her Deadtides will claim enough lives so that Nhimbaloth’s death will die; the accumulated spiritual energy she has digested will ultimately undo her ancient defeat, allowing her to once more exist as a physical being.</p><p>She will rise from death hungrier than ever.</p><h1>Dogma and Worshippers</h1><p>Nhimbaloth’s creed and worship are entirely the product of her cultists, as the Empty Death has little interest in providing her worshippers with direct inspiration or direction. This tradition echoes the pattern established with all other cults centered on entities of the Elder Mythos who similarly care not for their worshippers. Because of this lack of divine direction, while their worshippers strive to accomplish specific goals, they aren’t limited by anathemas.</p><p>In Nhimbaloth’s case, her worshippers seek to create undead—particularly ghosts and other incorporeal creatures—to provide sustenance for their eldritch icon. They also feast upon carnivores at their ceremonies, aping Nhimbaloth’s predation upon soul-eating monsters. Her faith is all but unknown in urban areas, but in isolated swamp villages, worship of the Empty Death can suffuse entire settlements. In such instances, the cult typically builds the shell of a mainstream church to serve as a front and satisfy any curious outsiders passing through, while worshipping their goddess at a hidden location in the heart of the night.</p><p>Lower-level clerics of Nhimbaloth dress in whatever corpse’s attire is commonly used in their society’s burial rites, choosing to wear a “final suit” or “last gown” during their rituals in hopes that sweet oblivion might answer their prayers. Cult leaders, however, often eschew this tradition, instead wearing dark green or gray hooded robes adorned with tangled sheets of clinging moss and skull-shaped masks adorned with veils of additional moss. The cultists favor flails in combat; these weapons often have heads shaped into four-pointed stars with the flail’s chain attached to the center of the star and handles wrapped in moss and tanned flesh stripped from the dead.</p><p>Humanoids are far from the Empty Death’s only worshippers. As mentioned, will-o’-wisps and their kin find much to admire in the sinister aura Nhimbaloth’s presence brings to desolate swamplands, and it doesn’t take long for them to take up faith in the Empty Death, almost as if feeding on fear spurred by her influence infects the wisps with devotion to her faith. Marsh giants have also been known to venerate Nhimbaloth under names like “Bogmother,” “The Rushlight Woman,” “Swampfire Queen,” or the like, although they pray to her more as a patron of swampland than anything else. Vampiric mists commonly appear in her swamplands as well, and many scholars have nervously wondered about the implied connection between Nhimbaloth’s mark and the clusters of seven perfectly spaced punctures vampiric mists leave in the bodies of those they’ve fed upon through their misty tendrils.</p><h1>Temples and Shrines</h1><p>Often, the members of a cult of the Empty Death consist of the truly desperate, those with little money and less hope. They conduct their worship in their homes, or what passes as a home—partially collapsed shacks, abandoned barns, or even slumped survivalists’ shelters all suffice for the worship of Nhimbaloth. The rarer cults led by deviants of means construct larger structures to honor Nhimbaloth and often build these structures as mockeries of other churches by including stained glass windows, mosaics, and other works of art that honor the Outer Goddess. In such cases, the structure often serves a secondary purpose, such as a castle, a manor house, or the like. Curiously, these larger structures often share a particular feature: a tower that serves as a beacon or lighthouse as a way to honor will-o’-wisps, which the cult adore. To her followers, will-o’-wisps are Nhimbaloth’s eyes, and her gaze looks out upon the world through the lambent glow of these supernatural predators. A beacon or lighthouse in a temple thus symbolizes a will-o’-wisp, but also, they believe it gives Nhimbaloth a lens through which to gaze upon the world.</p><p>Nhimbaloth’s symbol is a skull with moss stuffed into its jaws, although her cultists often create variants of it as crude dolls or effigies of moss-caked bones and fragments of skulls. Temples that can afford to be open about their affiliation with the goddess often adorn their structures with skulls that have moss carefully grown into soggy, vermin-infested beards or with moss draperies that hang down over archways to form moist curtains in place of proper doors.</p><h1>A Priest's Role</h1><p>As with most cults of the Elder Mythos, the majority of Nhimbaloth’s devout don’t worship out of respect or adoration so much as fear. For them, the concept of death isn’t what evokes nightmare, but the fear of what judgment might await in the afterlife is what drives most to her faith. Those who have sinned, who have committed heresy against a prior faith, or who simply live in constant terror of what Pharasma might say to them when they reach her throne instead seek the oblivion offered by Nhimbaloth. They seek not to escape death or life, but to escape what they fear will be an even worse afterlife.</p><p>Yet this is not the only motive that draws worshippers to her fold. Some, rather than being driven by a fear of the afterlife, are enticed by the opportunity to bask in the misery and despair of others. These members are some of the most awful in the sect, for they use the promise of oblivion that Nhimbaloth offers to those who worship her as a lure to draw in the desperate to aid their own nefarious plots. Some seek to use these eager-for-oblivion zealots as disposable armies for acts of vengeance or rage; others draw upon these worshippers as sacrifices to fuel abhorrent rituals or to craft horrific magic items.</p><p>Even these predators of the desperate pale in comparison to the worst of Nhimbaloth’s worshippers—nihilists who fully understand the Empty Death and see in her the ultimate tool to destroy a world they’ve grown to loathe. For these cultists, nothing less than using the Voidbracken to bring a Deadtide upon their world will suffice. They might have a hidden plan to escape the world the moment all life is ended; they might even seek their own oblivion or believe that Nhimbaloth herself might reward them with dominion over a dead world. Regardless of their intent, these doomsday shepherds are the most dangerous of the Empty Death’s worshippers.</p><h1>Holidays</h1><p>Cults of Nhimbaloth that exist in small communities under the guise of a different religion take pains to observe that faith’s holidays if visitors or (more rarely) townsfolk don’t know their gathering’s true faith, but apart from that, worshippers of the Empty Death don’t observe regular holidays or religious festivals—with one unusual exception. The exact date on which Nhimbaloth’s body was taken from her and Voidbracken was denuded of life is unknown, so each cult chooses one day of import to observe this anniversary. The fact that no one knows the length of Voidbracken’s year makes this ritual even more arbitrary; regardless, her faithful believe that on one of these so-called Void Dawns, the sun won’t rise upon the world and all life will be snuffed in a Deadtide. Cultists celebrate the night leading to a Void Dawn with a gluttonous feast consisting of all manner of carnivores and monsters—meals they often make during the proceedings while the “food” still lives. When the sun inevitably rises, the cultists choose one of their own as the final feast in atonement for failing to bring the Deadtide to their world.</p><h1>Aphorisms</h1><p>Worshippers of Nhimbaloth fondly quote and recite their favorite tales from The Whispering Reeds, each of which has a number of memorable and haunting lines. However, a variant of an infamous quote from the Necronomicon particularly resonates with all of her worshippers.</p><p><em><strong>\"Long Dream the Dead, Yet Even Death Can Die\"</strong></em></p><p>To many, the notion of death is akin to an eternal slumber, a dawnless rest in which the soul experiences an afterlife in the way a sleeping person could dream several different lives in the span of a single night. Whether a dreamer wakes with the dawn or dies in their sleep, all dreams eventually come to an end. Just as when the Empty Death comes to call, even death knows oblivion—and even death may die.</p><h1>Holy Text</h1><p>Mentions of Nhimbaloth are rare, even for the esoteric topic of the Outer Gods. The dread Necronomicon mentions her, and certain translations of that book purportedly contain descriptions of her true form, which might be the only place where Nhimbaloth’s true form is set down in print. This information isn’t even present in the text most often associated with her worship: a rare tome called <em>The Whispering Reeds</em>.</p><p>The genesis of <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> lies not in those who worship the Empty Death, but in those who sought to oppose her. The book consists of stories, myths, parables, and encounters with Nhimbaloth gathered from hundreds of regions in dozens of worlds. The compiler’s name has been long forgotten, as they neglected to name themself in the text. This matters not to those who worship Nhimbaloth, nor does the fact that the author originally penned the book for the purpose of cataloging the ways in which Nhimbaloth’s influence could be opposed. The very act of collecting these old stories of the Empty Death brushing against the world had the opposite effect, and now, those who seek to draw their goddess’s attention to their world uses <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> to spread stories of her previous visits.</p><h1>Relations with Other Religions</h1><p>Nhimbaloth doesn’t consort with other gods, although often her visitations upon the wilderness force confrontations with other faiths. In particular, Gozreh and Desna oppose her influence—the former because of the proliferation of unnatural elements that taint swamplands, and the latter out of a mixture of anger and fear that her flock might stumble into Nhimbaloth’s clutches accidentally while exploring the wilds. The Eldest of the First World also oppose Nhimbaloth, whose parasitic tendrils can occasionally drift into that plane through fey gates and portals. Even after driving out the Empty Death, small cults of fey who have fallen under her sway inevitably remain.</p><p>Pharasma opposes Nhimbaloth for multiple reasons. Those who perish in lands haunted by the latter’s presence tend to rise as ghosts. Moreover, the Empty Death’s habit of consuming those ghosts has rightly angered Pharasma, for rather than being released to the Boneyard, the consumed souls simply disappear. One might assume that such an affront to the cycle of life and death would compel Pharasma into a direct confrontation with Nhimbaloth, and indeed, certain ancient texts tell of such a clash between the two goddesses at the very dawn of mortal civilization. The titanic battle left neither goddess the victor. Nhimbaloth learned to hide her predations upon the world so that even Pharasma can’t readily find her, and one particularly blasphemous tale in The Whispering Reeds speaks of a hidden scar that Pharasma bears to this day as a reminder of her failed attempt to decisively defeat the Empty Death—a scar, supposedly, in the pattern of seven divots of flesh where Nhimbaloth fed upon the essence of the Goddess of Death.</p><p>Whether or not this myth has any basis in fact, the faithful of Pharasma view Nhimbaloth and her cult with a combination of hatred and fearful respect. Only the most devout and powerful of Pharasma’s worshippers receive leave to hunt Nhimbaloth’s faithful, and they work hard to prevent lay worshippers from learning much of the Empty Death. Their justification—that Nhimbaloth feeds only on ghosts, and that by defeating or preventing the formation of theses undead, they strike blows against the Empty Death—reads to some as an excuse.</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Nhimbaloth's Inspiration</h3><p>H. P. Lovecraft encouraged others to add to the mythos of eldritch beings he created to populate his weird fiction, and it was in this tradition that I first created Nhimbaloth as an antagonist for my own stories and roleplaying campaigns. Largely inspired by the mysterious horror lurking behind nature’s veil in Algernon Blackwood’s classic short story “The Willows,” and with some valuable advice on Outer God naming conventions from the fine folks at Chaosium, Nhimbaloth has become one of my proudest additions to the ever-expanding Lovecraft Mythos.</p><p><em><strong>- James Jacobs</strong></em></p></article></section>"

While many monsters beneath the citadel died, others have prospered, and now several communities of morlocks, urdefhans, ghouls, and stranger creatures call the dungeons home. Only the longest-lived remember any life other than the dungeons. Belcorra had bound several devils to serve her as overseers and administrators, and many of these still maintain order. Apart from the regions maintained by these devils and a drow outpost in one of the lowest levels, the Abomination Vaults are lawless and dangerous.</p><h2>Wandering Monsters</h2><p>While this book doesn’t present wandering monster tables for Abomination Vaults, the dungeon’s denizens still occasionally leave their homes! You can make the dungeon feel more dynamic by familiarizing yourself with each level’s denizens and then having them react to the party’s progression and presence. For example, if the heroes noisily explore an area, creatures in nearby rooms could come to investigate or perhaps set up an ambush. If the heroes decide to camp out in the dungeon rather than return to the safety of town, nearby creatures might visit or even attack their campsite while they rest. If the heroes clear out the denizens of a level and then return weeks later, they might find that new monsters have moved in. By keeping the inhabitants of the Abomination Vaults active, you can make the location feel all the more dangerous and unpredictable to your players.</p><h2>Beyond Gauntlight</h2><p>The ruins of Gauntlight Keep aren’t far out of town—just a 20-minute walk from Otari to the ruins. The Abomination Vaults Adventure Path focuses almost entirely on the dungeon itself, and you can gloss over the details of trips between the dungeon and town as you see fit. If your players express interest in mixing things up, you can use some of the encounters or short adventures in the standalone Pathfinder Adventure: Troubles in Otari. That adventure presents additional content in the Otari hinterlands suitable for 2nd- to 4th-level characters and provides great ways to prepare heroes who need a bit of extra XP before they delve into the deeper, more dangerous levels of the Abomination Vaults.</p>"

Otari’s beginning is relatively recent and involved a few false starts along the way. When @UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.snj2fGhhuxfAInom] arrived in the region in 4230 AR, drawn by a series of sinister visions, the coastal region was practically uninhabited. Here, she built @UUID[.efRUYLBH9Kf3CLkX], the keep surrounding the area, and the sprawling dungeons below the structure—without attracting notice. A group of adventurers known as the @UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.Gx2mnbeUctXU7XUN] eventually learned of Belcorra’s villainy and slew her, but at the cost of one of their own: a rogue named Otari Ilvashti.</p><h3>Early Otari (4244-4294 AR)</h3><p>Having lost both their friend and their taste for adventuring, the three surviving members of the Roseguard decided to retire. They spent much of their savings constructing several buildings and a sizable pier in a sheltered cove south of the site of their final battle. Since their lost friend’s fondest dream had been to settle down in a small seaside village, they named this new village after him.</p><p>For some decades, Otari prospered as a fishing village, though its population never grew beyond a hundred or so. The three surviving Roseguard adventurers lived to a ripe old age, ultimately passing away from natural causes—an accomplishment many adventurers never achieve.</p><h3 style=\"font-size:var(--h3-font-size);font-family:var(--h3-font)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--h3-font)\">Decline (4290-4294 AR)</span></h3><p>With the passing of the last Roseguard, Aesephna Menhemes, in 4290 AR, Otari's fortunes began to dwindle. Within the span of a few years, its citizens had all drifted elsewhere, and by 4294 AR the town was entirely empty.</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/dawnflower-night.webp\" width=\"700\" /></figure><h3>Stonescale Kobolds (4300-4310 AR)</h3><p>Otari lay abandoned for decades, before a group of kobolds called the Stonescales moved in. When the kobolds started luring in passing ships during bad weather to ambush their crews and steal their cargo, it didn't take long for new adventurers to arrive and vanquish them.</p><h3>Otari Rebuilt (4310-4721 AR)</h3><p>While the adventurers moved on soon thereafter, their backer, Maklanni Menhemes, remained behind. Maklanni, Aesephna's granddaughter, conceived a plan to revitalize Otari as a lumber town. It already contained dozens of buildings that only needed to be restored, after all, and the Osprey River remained ideal for a mill and lumberyard. However, one setback complicated Maklanni's plan- the steep slopes and cliffs surrounding Otari made transporting timber to the ocean difficult.</p><p>Maklanni's solution was ingenious- she constructed a wooden flume that allowed for the easy transport of lumber from the woods to her mill and, from there, down an astounding loading ramp that extended from the top of the 200-foot-tall cliff to the harbor below. The mill and flume made Maklanni wealthy and revitalized Otari, although it made her an enemy of the Kortos Consortium, which had a stranglehold on the island's lumber industry. Two other small lumber companies broke from the Kortos Consortium and settled in Otari as well, each paying for use of Maklanni's invention.</p><h3>Otari Today</h3><p>Today, Otari is a thriving settlement- the largest on the coast between Absalom and Diobel. Maklanni is long dead, but her descendant @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.WirKAYn5ZGirmgjb] carries on the family trade and also serves as the town's mayor. Unsavory representatives of the Kortos Consortium have secretly infiltrated Otari and seek to undermine the town's security. However, a far greater threat looms over the city: Belcorra has returned and is preparing to light the baleful fires of <em>Gauntlight</em> once again!</p><figure><img class=\"light-writer\" src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/vignettes/otari-docks.webp\" width=\"700\" /></figure>"

Thank you.\" She then invites the heroes to stay in the overflow lodging (area @UUID[.uEordq4ZgyMwVB7O]) until she makes up her mind.

Bhazrade and Klathor are, as before, lurking at the edges of the room. Quara explains the following.</p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">\"I believe you've been truthful with me, so I'm going to be truthful with you. Yldaris only exists at Belcorra's pleasure. It was here when she first created her vast dungeons; at the time, my grandfather was its leader. Belcorra made allies of several groups, including drow, urdefhans to the west, and the deep gnomes above, who have embraced undeath. To each, she gave a large magical lens with strange powers. For safekeeping, I believe. Ours was the Ochre Fulcrum Lens, and it could manipulate emotions.<br /> \"But there was more to the lens. My grandfather told my father, Larathols, who became Yldaris's leader after him. But my father never told me.\" Quara sighs. \"I was never meant to lead. My older sister was to succeed my father. They both embarked on a secret expedition a few years ago. On an island in the great lake, the urdefhan warlord Khurfel caught and killed them. Their expedition had something to do with the lens, I believe, and I suspect my father had it with him. Perhaps he hid it someplace; perhaps Khurfel took it. I don't know.\"<br /> \"Belcorra came to me as a ghost shortly afterward. She insisted I swear Yldaris's support and aid in a surface invasion that drives her even in death. For the good of Yldaris, I renewed the vows my grandfather made. But I've never felt bound by mere words. I won't help her. I'll help you. You're welcome in Yldaris as long as you'd like.\"</p><p>The heroes can ask Quara more questions if they'd like, but she knows little else. Before the conversation winds down, however, Bhazrade and Klathor speak.</p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">\"There is more...\" one of the twins says. They move their mouths in unison, making it hard to tell which is speaking.<br /> \"...you should know,\" the other drow continues.<br /> This plainly piques Quara's interest, and she motions for the brothers to go on.<br /> \"The ochre lens lies in a dark and wet place. Khurfel didn't claim it. Larathols dropped it in the water to deny it to his enemy. He died attempting to learn more of its purpose, more than the partial truth we know,\" one twin speaks.<br /> \"We have seen in a vision that the stones both empower the Ghost Queen and hold the key to her demise. They are slivers of something ancient, alien, evil, and hungry,\" the other continues.<br /> \"We saw eyes of Empty Death!\" they cry in unison.<br /> \"She separated the lenses because, together, they draw the baleful attention of the Empty Death. Even the Ghost Queen cannot withstand the Empty Death when their powers are joined within her. The secrets to the lenses are in the old treasure vault, which overlooks the lake.\"<br /> \"Find the lenses and the answers Larathols sought.\"</p><p>The twin seers fall silent again, and Quara looks back to the heroes. She explains, \"I would say you get used to Bhazrade and Klathor, but one never does. Let me assure you that when they do speak, it's important. This is all news to me, but when their words benefit Yldaris, and you as well.\"</p><h3>Consulting the Whispering Reeds:</h3><p>The heroes might have recovered a book of Nhimbaloth’s lore, called The Whispering Reeds, from higher in the Abomination Vaults. A hero who consults this tome finds references to the fulcrum lenses without a check to Recall Knowledge and without suffering from the book’s curse. The Whispering Reeds speaks of slivers of Nhimbaloth’s essence existing in the fulcrum lenses, perhaps as a means to contact the Outer God. The fulcrum lenses possess different and powerful (but, in the text, unspecified) abilities. Yet the fulcrum lenses are dangerous in close proximity, and even Nhimbaloth’s worshippers fear to bring more than two or three together. Using their powers draws Nhimbaloth’s scrutiny and invites destruction.</p><h3>XP Award:</h3><p>Award the heroes 120 XP for allying with Quara and the Yldaris drow.</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Side Quest:</h3><p>Finding the fulcrum lenses and using them against Belcorra is the primary goal of the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path. But Quara has a side task that's personally important to her: she'd like Khurfel killed and his rhoka sword brought to her as a trophy. As pragmatic as Quara is, she carries the common drow vice of vengeance. She emphasizes to the heroes that Khurfel would never part with the lens while he draws breath, so defeating him is necessary in any case.</p></article></section>"

In the center of the room is a dusty mechanism of copper and silver. It’s missing its lenses but otherwise looks like the framework of a lantern that belongs in the top of a lighthouse. The dust in this room has been recently disturbed.</p> <p>This is Belcorra’s most protected vault, holding her treasures and secrets of her past. The books that have been most recently shelved here—as evidenced by the trails in the dust—are research journals Belcorra penned when she was alive. They’re centuries old, but careful magical preservation has kept them from falling apart. These journals describe four fulcrum lenses (in crimson, ebon, emerald, and ochre) that focus Nhimbaloth’s soul-extinguishing gaze across space and time.</p> <p>Belcorra’s journal details how she built Gauntlight and created a special framework called the Fulcrum Lattice to fit the four lenses and harness their power. A diagram of the Fulcrum Lattice makes it clear that the device is the very one sitting here. Belcorra expresses some trepidation at using the fulcrum lenses; they each contain a sliver of Nhimbaloth’s essence, and bringing them in close proximity can be dangerous. More specifically, the lenses impart Nhimbaloth’s essence into those who use or are touched by them. Having all four essences imbued at once is sure to bring Nhimbaloth’s dreadful scrutiny. Belcorra had her talented apprentice, Volluk Azrinae, fashion mundane lenses that would allow Gauntlight to function at a diminished capacity until the Fulcrum Lattice and the fulcrum lenses could be installed, on the eve of Belcorra’s assault on Absalom. The Fulcrum Lattice allows all four of the large, heavy lenses to be carried with ease.</p> <p>Belcorra’s journals explain that she used only the Ebon Fulcrum Lens in the Empty Vault at Gauntlight’s base, deeming the essence within one fulcrum lens a minimal risk. She gave the other lenses to trusted groups in the lower vaults: the emerald lens to the urdefhans, the ochre lens to the drow, and the crimson lens hidden where her undead gnome minions could protect it. She trusts that the groups won’t work together, much less learn that bringing the lenses together to imbue a single creature with all four splinters of Nhimbaloth’s essence would impart total annihilation.</p> <h3 style=\"font-size:var(--h3-font-size);font-family:var(--h3-font)\">XP Award</h3> <p style=\"font-family:var(--main-font);font-size:var(--body-font-size)\">Award the heroes 80 XP for uncovering the lore of the fulcrum lenses and learning how to destroy Belcorra.</p> <h3>Other Books</h3> <p>The other books are aging tomes full of occult knowledge; they’ve been in the Haruvex family for generations.

An enormous stone throne carved out of heavy blocks stands in a domed chamber opposite the black doors.</p> <p>Well before Belcorra’s time, this served as a semipublic area of worship for a cult of Nhimbaloth. Those seeking vengeance, an enemy’s obliteration, or assurance that a lost loved one would return as a ghost left offerings and sacrifices around the throne and the creature sitting on it, who was called Lady’s Whisper—the creature that sits there still. Aspirants hoped the shrouded skeleton would rise and lead them through one of the three doorways to take the tests to become an initiate in the cult. Lady’s Whisper sometimes remained still for years, or ushered in new cultists for days on end. Although even the senior cultists never understood the connection between Lady’s Whisper and Nhimbaloth, none questioned the skeleton’s role as gateway to cult membership.</p> <p>The cultists did know, however, that only those Lady’s Whisper ushered into the eastern door would join the cult. The western doors lead to grim fates reserved for those unworthy to even be tested for admittance to the cult.</p> <p>Lady’s Whisper is a unique undead creature distantly related to the @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.pkNWilK2pHZ5TDsd]{Lesser Deaths} that serve the @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.mGr4e6fH3w8ewcSX]{Grim Reaper}.

It knows that the heroes are here to face Belcorra and are ill-suited to join the now-nonexistent cult, but it decides to put them through the initiation trials anyway in the hopes of weakening and killing them. Lady’s Whisper commands the allegiance of the many dread wisps within the Gate of Nhimbaloth, but there are none here to defend it when the heroes first arrive, so it deals with the heroes cautiously.</p> <p>Lady’s Whisper rises and holds forth both hands, gesturing for peace. It then points to the eastern door and whispers the names of each hero, one by one. It steps toward the eastern door, gesturing for the heroes to follow.</p> <section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/encounter/skull.webp\" width=\"100\" /> <section> <h2>Encounter</h2> <h2>Moderate 9</h2> </section> <section> <div> <p>@Actor[dWOK0nzGWyc5NkNz]{Lady's Whisper}</p> </div> <p>80 XP</p> </section> </header> <article> <p>If the heroes attack, Lady’s Whisper lashes out with its claws to teleport heroes away, preferably into the adjacent chambers with dangerous wisps and traps.

Urthagul used to leave this way every week or two to hunt for food in the lake but hadn’t bothered to do so while the calignis were bringing him offerings.</p><h3>Distracting Whispers</h3><p>Creatures in the cavern are immune to emotion effects, but spending time amid the whispers affects the mind.

This condition is cumulative, up to @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 4}.</p><p>The whispers speak a different truth each time a creature here increases its stupefied condition, as follows.</p><p>• <strong>Stupefied 1</strong>: “The lenses. She knows the secrets of the lenses. Three are within reach, one very close. The other lost by Yldaris. One held by the blood eaters.”</p><p>• <strong>Stupefied 2</strong>: “She keeps them apart while she works her petty vengeance, but the essences shall become one.”</p><p>• <strong>Stupefied 3</strong>: “Find the lenses and place their essences together within a host.”</p><p>• <strong>Stupefied 4</strong>: “Join the essences within Haruvex, and she can fall again. This is a promise of the Empty Death, a promise of empty death.”</p><p>The cavern affects aberrations and sorcerers with the aberrant bloodline differently; they don’t gain the stupefied condition but are fascinated while within the cavern. This fascination ends as soon as they leave. If such creatures stay here too long, they involuntarily babble strange truths that echo in the whispers, which is how Urthagul obtained his reputation as a mystic among the calignis.</p><section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/encounter/skull-glow.webp\" width=\"100\" /><section><h2>Encounter</h2><h2>Moderate 8</h2></section><section><div><p>@Actor[0jvmec4yJH1ASfRy]{Urthagal}</p></div><p>80 XP</p></section></header><article><figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/items/crimson-fulcrum-lens.webp\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption>@UUID[JournalEntry.qv54jw6NdryeFh51.JournalEntryPage.zsRCDb88wiih1BMd]</figcaption></figure><p>On the northernmost island, amid a nest of glowing toadstools, lurks the gug Urthagul.

It might seem like the morlocks intend to set up the heroes to fight against the band, but they call for a battle of entertainment, not of weapons.

A band member provides the best solo performance they can on their instrument of choice, then the paired hero can attempt a DC 22 check with a relevant skill, such as Performance, Acrobatics, Athletics, or any you deem appropriate to impress a crowd.

Shadow Malice performs a high-energy musical number, then passes over their instruments for the heroes to use (if the heroes don’t have any instruments of their own). Unlike the individual contests, this phase requires a Performance check. If the heroes balk, Ryta grins and says, \"This stage is for performers, friends.\"</p><p>To compete, one hero must attempt a @Check[type:performance|dc:22|traits:action:perform]{Performance} check.

Word gets back to Vischari about the heroes' success, and the tavern manager treats them with a modicum of respect.</p><p>On a critical success, Ryta gives the heroes the group's instruments, insisting that the instruments belong in the hands of such talented performers. The other members of Shadow Malice grumble at this decision but sullenly comply.</p></article><article><h3>Heroes Lose</h3><p>If the lead performer fails at this final Performance check, Shadow Malice sees the heroes as being out of their depth and resolves to attack the heroes right on the stage, as described in the encounter in area @UUID[.w7j4LONWc9tgS5ci].

He says only that the city welcomes traders and that the heroes should visit, peacefully, if they come to the area.

The heroes’ encounter with Falxi should suggest that Yldaris is a safe place to visit, and set the stage for a peaceful encounter with drow living in the lower levels.</p> <h3>Jedzeli</h3> <p>This unfortunate skulk hangs limply on her hook, her right hand visibly missing. She constantly mumbles and murmurs about “the man in colored rags who takes hands.” Other attempts at conversation with her prove unintelligible. Before Ysondkhelir discovered the psychic human girl, Dorianna Menhemes, he amused himself by tormenting Jedzeli’s dreams. With a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:22]{Perception} check, a hero who has interacted with Dorianna notices some disturbing similarities with the way Jedzeli mutters about the “man in colored rags.” Helping Jedzeli reclaim her sanity is a long and difficult road outside the scope of this adventure, but Glashdrumdur offers to look out for her if the heroes set them both free.</p> <h3>XP Award</h3> <p>Award the heroes 30 XP for each prisoner they set free and help to reach an exit to the Abomination Vaults.</p> <section class=\"box-text treasure\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/treasure/coin-pouch.webp\" width=\"100\" /> <h2>Treasure</h2> <p>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.FL8QU8TcNauBMMhD]{Belladonna Poison}</p> </header> <article> <p>While nothing in this kitchen is suitable for consumption by anyone but perhaps a goblin, a large jar labeled \"deadly nightshade\" lies at the bottom of one of the mushroom baskets.

Finishing the golem requires Jafaki’s knowledge and expertise; doing so goes beyond the heroes’ current capabilities.</span></p> <p>The heroes can, however, disconnect the machine to end the morlock’s torment. Disconnecting this machinery requires a hero to succeed at a @Check[type:occultism|dc:22]{Occultism} check. On a success, the morlock head dies and the machinery can’t be used again. On a failure, or if the heroes simply smash the machine, the morlock head dies, but the invisible energies accumulated within the machine seek another source of stitched skin and meat to animate as a flesh golem.</p> <p>If the heroes left the fleshy statue of Belcorra intact in the Temple of the Canker (area F34), these errant energies animate it as a flesh golem (Pathfinder Bestiary 184) instead. The flesh golem comes to life with an instinctive drive to find and kill whoever ruined the machine. It always knows the distance and direction to the hero responsible and immediately begins pursuit down through the Abomination Vaults. As the golem is far away, it might take hours to catch up to the heroes, at your discretion, but when it does, it fights until destroyed.</p> <h3>XP Award</h3> <p>Award the heroes 80 XP, rather than 30 XP, for successfully disconnecting the occult machinery. If they fail, award them this amount if they defeat the flesh golem in combat.</p> </article> </section> <section class=\"box-text treasure\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/treasure/coin-pouch.webp\" width=\"100\" /> <h2>Treasure</h2> <p>@Actor[Qpxj7x2ZppXLzaPl]{Jafaki's Laboratory}</p> </header> <article> <p>Scattered around the room are all the pieces for an expanded alchemist's lab, expanded healer's tools, and a superb repair kit.

The last several pages of the journal document much of her work in building the Abomination Vaults. While the journal doesn’t offer many specific details, it mentions construction of fleshwarping laboratories, arenas where she pitted enemies against monstrous champions for her amusement, prisons, torture chambers, links to the Darklands, and a great temple where “once the Empty Death herself brushed against this fragile world.” Belcorra’s entries often speak of her minions in the abstract, as if bragging about how many have come to serve her in creating the complex, but she only ever mentions one by name: her “amusingly vain” apprentice, Volluk Azrinae. One of the last entries describes how this apprentice arrived from “a community of upstart and meddlesome drow below” to serve Belcorra.

Unlike many of Belcorra's minions, the voidglutton came to her of its own free will, drawn from across the dimensions by echoes of Nhimbaloth's presence. It volunteered to aid Belcorra as a guardian of the upper shrine (area @UUID[.CGaM81kBLtYIxmqu]), but once she relocated her personal effects to deeper within the Abomination Vaults, it took over these rooms. It basks in the latent fears and pains of the dungeon's haunts and ghosts.</p> <p>When Belcorra rose as a ghost, the voidglutton took note and visited her, learning of her plans to reactivate Gauntlight and realizing it would take time to awaken the dormant artifact. The voidglutton helped her refine the plans to testing Gauntlight and has recently done so with Volluk's aid (as the heroes experienced at the beginning of Chapter 2). Since then, the voidglutton has lurked here, understanding that it's just a matter of time before Belcorra contacts it again to enact the next stage of her plan.</p> <p>The voidglutton moves from room to room in this area, as it finds the echoes of Belcorra's spirit soothing. It therefore has an equal chance of being in area D20a, D20b, D20c, or D20d when the heroes arrive. It notes the heroes' intrusion immediately, however, and swiftly moves to confront them. The creature has no interest in negotiation; it attacks at once and fights to the death, but it doesn't pursue heroes who flee these rooms. If the voidglutton clearly has the upper hand over a group of intruders, it might offer to let most of them flee if they leave it a single survivor to torment to death over a few months.</p> </article> </section>"

He fashioned the door for himself, but he had to manufacture a magical pendant for Belcorra so she could bypass it. Shortly before Belcorra’s death, Urevian had the imp Szek steal the pendant back. Urevian broke it into five pieces, giving one to each of his lieutenants. His trusted devils can come and go as they please, but even they know not to bother Urevian barring official business.</p><p>The desk contains reports, inventories, and maps that depict the surface world, Gauntlight, and the surrounding Darklands. Of particular note to the heroes are complete maps of the fifth, sixth, and seventh levels of the Abomination Vaults, including all secret doors on those levels.

He keeps two barbazu bodyguards nearby at all times to intercept reports from his lieutenants and to keep him from being disturbed. When the heroes open the doors, the barbazus spring forward, but Urevian stops them and warmly greets the heroes. Read or paraphrase the following.</p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">As a ruggedly handsome devil steps forward, as the long rolls of parchment hanging from his horns curl up, then unroll again.<br />\"Friends, friends! Weapons away. Truly, I am happy to see you.\" The devil turns to the two bearded devil bodyguards, their glaives raised. \"Stand down, you two. I doubt they are arrogant enough to fight us.\"<br />\"I am Urevian, phistophilus and contracted agent of Belcorra, but I assure you I am no enemy of yours. You seek to vanquish her? Put an end to her murderous spirit, the threat she poses to mortal life, et cetera, et cetera? Then perhaps we can broker a deal- one that greatly benefits both of us with a minimal number of precious lives lost.\"</p><p>If the heroes already encountered Szek and made an agreement with her- which Urevian doesn't really mind- he adds, \"You already struck a bargain with Szek, so I know it is not a matter of if, but of what price. Trust me when I say, I am offering you an excellent deal.\" For this conversation, refer to the following list of likely questions and Urevian responses.</p><dl><dt><p>Who are you?</p></dt><dd><p>\"I am Urevian, a contract devil of some renown, if I do say so myself.\"</p></dd><dt><p>What do you want from us?</p></dt><dd><p>\"Simply put, you are the third-party agents I need to get out of this dreadful place and return home. You see, there is something I want but am not allowed to go and get myself, nor can I employ any infernal agents to retrieve it. No, the hands of a mortal foe of Belcorra must deliver me my prize. My devils are valueless in this regard, as are my fleshwarp soldiers\"</p></dd><dt><p>Why does it have to be a mortal foe of Belcorra?</p></dt><dd><p>\"That is the delight of legalistic contract interpretation. It cannot be me, any of my minions, or any ally of Belcorra. The contract was written with the intent that Belcorra alone could give me the prize as my payment. Which, of course, she will not until I have given her the full measure of service the contract requires. However, a very technical reading means any of her foes can also provide it- and you have thus far conclusively demonstrated that you oppose her.\"</p></dd><dt><p>What is it that you want?</p></dt><dd><p>\"I require the soul of Carman Rajani. In his living body, if possible, though I can make do should he... perish.\"</p></dd><dt><p>What do you want with Carman's soul?</p></dt><dd><p>\"I owe the soul of a Rajani to someone much more powerful than myself.

There it can be captured. If you sign an agreement with me, I shall teach it to you.\"</p></dd><dt><p>We can't give you someone's soul. That's evil!</p></dt><dd><p>\"Is it? I say it is a lesser evil to turn over the soul of one corrupted individual than to allow an entire town's destruction. Far less bloodshed on all sides. I do not want to raze Otari, and I don't want to kill you. However, the contract I have with Belcorra requires that as long as I remain within her employ, I must pursue the domination of the surface world and the destruction of her enemies. Once my contract ends, so does my obligation to her. All I need is the soul of Carman Rajani to fulfill the contract.</p></dd><dt><p>How's Carman Rajani corrupted?</p></dt><dd><p>\"Oh, that bastard of a man.

A bright light shines down into the center of each chamber. A catwalk 10 feet above the ground circles around the edge of the room without handrail or banister; at the western side, each stops at a staircase leading down.</p> <p>Belcorra kept dangerous creatures in this room prior to teleporting them via Gauntlight’s beam. Each cell is 10 feet square, 20 feet tall, and made of transparent stone. Each creature stands motionless in its own column, held in suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creatures haven’t aged and ignore any effect from the normal timestream as long as they stay imprisoned within their stasis chambers. However, such effects can work on the pillars, which are made of transparent, magically enhanced stone (Hardness 18, HP 76).</p> <h3>Occupied Chambers</h3> <p>Ten pillars are occupied. Nine contain living creatures: a @Actor[aD76W2uEQhFFUrom]{Chuul}, a @Actor[B7eLG2k7qUo8HU6O]{Drider}, three @Actor[xdIHvCBspeSXRL6A]{Ghonhatines}, a @Actor[dEAneTvoPuQXZoLR]{Gibbering Mouther}, a @Actor[T6vOuhM1KV5Fr75F]{Gibtanius}, and two @Actor[zq18QX6CBJNeUIgG]{Gugs}.

On a failure, the creature returns to normal time and attacks anything in sight until destroyed. (High-level monsters, such as the ghonhatines, pose a serious danger even for 7th-level characters!)</p> <h3>Empty Chambers</h3> <p>Of the five empty stasis chambers, two are noteworthy.</p> <p>The northwest chamber appears badly blackened, as though from soot on the inside. After the error with the gogiteth, Belcorra appointed a hag to oversee this room, knowing that her magical expertise would prove invaluable in maintaining the stasis chambers, but she didn’t intend the hag to do this job in life. Belcorra trapped the hag in this pillar, burned her to death, and bound her spirit as a witchfire. A creature entering a square adjacent to this blackened pillar receives a brief telepathic flash of Belcorra burning the hag alive and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the witchfire’s spells and abilities for 1 minute. A creature adjacent to that pillar can also just make out the objects inside it (see Treasure below). The pillar must be smashed open to retrieve them.</p> <p>The second unusual stasis chamber, in the southwest, looks like the other empty chambers. However, its top and floor are both illusions. An open area below the chamber’s “floor” leads to a 5-foot-wide crawl space to the open trapdoor in area @UUID[.lNmEdSB5CToA5aKq].

His map of the first level omits areas A12 to A13, areas A19 to A23, area A25, and all of the secret doors. His map of the second level is obviously much less complete.

                            "text": "<p class=\" box-text narrative\">This strangely shaped chamber is humid and oppressively clammy. The room’s four wings each contain a massive pool of bubbling swamp water. Flickering motes of light and darkness play underneath the surface of the pools. The chamber’s center is partially blocked by a circle of towering black standing stones, which crackle with eerie energy that shoots up into a shaft in the ceiling. Seven narrow channels, as though dug into the stone by a seven-fingered hand, run from each pool and three of the walls to a moat in the center of the room. From there, the water flows under the wall to the east, between a pair of black stone double doors. An island in the moat holds a smooth altar topped with a black lens the size of a fist.</p> <p>The Empty Vault has always been a generation pit for the wisps who serve Nhimbaloth. A funnel of swamp, despair, and ghostly energies, it’s mystically connected to the various swamp plant basins throughout the lower Abomination Vaults. Any follower of Nhimbaloth can telepathically communicate with wisps adjacent to the basins from here.</p> <p>The Empty Vault drew Belcorra’s soul after the Roseguard killed her, and her ghost reappeared here 500 years after the most traumatic event in her life—not her death, but her family’s exile from Absalom. Belcorra can’t leave this chamber for long, so she uses her wisp proxies and bound agents to enact her will throughout the Abomination Vaults. She keeps the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.CTiLugp5ptSItEqN]{Ebon Fulcrum Lens} on the altar to restore its energies; while here, it can regain its glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence, but this takes time.</p> <p>The seven swamp water rivulets are both dangerous and noxious, as they mark where Nhimbaloth once touched the world. It’s a simple matter to step over them, but they pull unpleasantly at the life energy of anyone who crosses them. At the end of any turn in which a hero crosses a rivulet (whether by Striding, Stepping, Flying, or any other means), the hero must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:22]{Fortitude} save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1}. This DC increases by 2 for each additional unique rivulet crossed during that turn (for example, a hero who crosses over 3 rivulets in their turn must attempt a DC 26 Fortitude saving throw). The doomed condition is cumulative on subsequent rounds. Crossing the pools doesn’t have this effect, so the heroes might learn that there are safer ways to move about the room than simply walking in a direct line. The rivulets have no effect on followers of Nhimbaloth, including Belcorra and the dread wisps.</p> <p>The black stone menhirs help support Gauntlight’s weight and emit the twisting ribbon of eerie energy that writhes up the shaft through areas @UUID[JournalEntry.uMZ0RiCcPSqsx1Nm.JournalEntryPage.8pbhSFgv71lvCz9M], @UUID[JournalEntry.KeWKr2yd8dbppeS5.JournalEntryPage.eOv6LI3wvIuKyyNJ], @UUID[JournalEntry.FwWmtOBFHhvM2gtf.JournalEntryPage.rVwX8eSwEBHWEjcg], and @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc.JournalEntryPage.NaEg1IQHphXU25Nk]. Belcorra can manipulate this ribbon of energy to power Gauntlight.</p> <h1>The Final Battle</h1> <p>If the heroes defeat Belcorra shortly before they reach the Empty Vault, she uses the power of the Ebon Fulcrum Lens to hasten her rejuvenation so she can face them in her sanctum.</p> <p>Belcorra doesn't ever surrender or flee in the Empty Vault. The heroes could possibly face her here without yet having the ability to permanently defeat her. In this case, they'll need to retreat to collect the fulcrum lenses and return to face her again. Once the heroes can focus Nhimbaloth's gaze upon Belcorra, they can defeat the sorcerer for good.</p> <h2>Destroying Belcorra</h2> <p>Belcorra only stops rejuvenating once she completes her goal of inflicting murderous revenge upon Absalom—but there’s another way to end her villainy for good. Nhimbaloth, the devourer of spirits, can utterly annihilate the ghost so she troubles the world no longer. Drawing the reclusive and inhuman Nhimbaloth’s attention isn’t easy, but Belcorra laid the groundwork for this by relying so heavily upon the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.CTiLugp5ptSItEqN]{Ebon Fulcrum Lens}. Nhimbaloth is already inclined to turn her spirit-consuming attention to Belcorra because Belcorra has made frequent use of the glimmers of Nhimbaloth’s essence within the item. The heroes must strengthen this contact by imbuing Belcorra with the splinters of Nhimbaloth’s essence in the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.yAqGhT0GuZrkvWZl]{Crimson Fulcrum Lens}, the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.IS1P6er2hLyKXAss]{Emerald Fulcrum Lens}, and the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.I2ul8Bzcth7sleow]{Ochre Fulcrum Lens} (it’s easier to do so via the @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.JwHNSaiwwqF7VCC5]{Fulcrum Lattice}, but that item isn’t strictly required). Each splinter gives Belcorra a bit more power, but all three together (building upon her past use of the Ebon Fulcrum Lens) draw Nhimbaloth’s dread gaze to her ghostly devotee.</p> <section class=\"box-text encounter\"><header><img src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/journal-images/icons/encounter/skull.webp\" width=\"100\" /> <section> <h2>Encounter</h2> <h2>Extreme 10</h2> </section> <section> <div> <p>@Actor[DDJGNAh3rfyIupAb]{Belcorra Haruvex} @Actor[QnbMaJPU7jG4uhaC]{Soul Feeders (1 to 4)}</p> </div> <p>180 XP</p> </section> </header> <article> <p style=\"font-family:var(--main-font);font-size:var(--body-font-size)\">If Belcorra hasn’t yet rejuvenated, the Ebon Fulcrum Lens automatically rejuvenates her when the heroes arrive.

A tremendous and hideous wail emanates from somewhere beyond this chamber—indeed, it seems, from beyond the Material Plane. All creatures in the Abomination Vaults must succeed a @Check[type:will|dc:30]{Will} save or become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 3} (a creature that critically fails is also @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed} for [[/r 1d4]] rounds). At the start of the following round, Nhimbaloth’s essence pervades the room.</p> <p class=\" box-text narrative\">A terrible, blackish-gray mist seeps into the room. It stinks of a fetid bog and leaves a layer of cloying, slimy water upon everything it passes. The mist twists in shape and form, with seven-fingered tentacles appearing and disappearing in the fog.</p> <p>This misty incarnation can’t be attacked or damaged. It flows into Belcorra, who shrieks, “No! I deserve your power, not your attention! My death is full of rage and strength—it is not empty!” Despite these protestations, Belcorra’s form is pulled apart into the mist, and the mist vanishes.</p> <p>An immense grinding noise comes from high above. Gauntlight, Belcorra’s greatest work, is collapsing, one level at a time. With each passing round, the artifact drops one dungeon level along the lighthouse’s footprint (but not in the rest of the Abomination Vaults!), obliterating anything directly beneath it. In the 9th round, it collapses into this chamber, destroying everything here—by then, the heroes would best be gone.</p> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>With Belcorra destroyed, Otari and Absalom are safe from her spiteful schemes. The heroes receive a warm welcome in Otari, and everyone wants to hear their tales over a friendly fire, good food, and more than a few drinks. The heroes are told, retold, and embellished upon for generations.</p> <p>Gauntlight is no more, and only the pit in the Fogfen marks the spot it once stood. The dangers lurking there might one day regain their strength and menace the surface—but those are tales for other heroes.</p>"

Since this rebellion, Jafaki has maintained the level as the seugathis’ domain, believing their resources are better spent on the relentless refining of experiments rather than expanding territory.</p><p>Due to Jafaki’s relatively relaxed disposition toward administration, creatures on this level tend to look after themselves.

Within the Empty Vault, Belcorra empowered four fulcrum lenses that, when installed in the lighthouse high above, focus Nhimbaloth’s attention and unleash the artifact’s full power.

The most significant of these occurrences centers around @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.WirKAYn5ZGirmgjb]’s eldest daughter, the teenaged Dorianna Menhemes. Dorianna is on the cusp of developing psychic powers. While no one on the surface is aware of this, a denizen of Leng named @UUID[Actor.8AVy2qIK6vh13sSj] (area @UUID[JournalEntry.OyNcqrpRClyhr8BJ.JournalEntryPage.RiUE936phCZx8Hqe]) has become aware of her power. With the barrier to the lower levels down, he can twist her dreams into nightmares and take the role of her savior. He intensifies this long plan over weeks of nighttime adventures with her in the Dimension of Dreams. Ysondkhelir intends to eventually thrust Dorianna physically into the Dimension of Dreams to augment other denizens’ plots.</p><h2>The First Dreams</h2><p>Two nights after the heroes open the seal to the Abomination Vaults’ lower levels, Dorianna Menhemes begins having horrifying nightmares. She awakens several times each night, screaming and clutching a stuffed griffon she hasn’t touched in years. When asked, she doesn’t recall the specifics of these nightmares beyond her fear and the appearance of a man shrouded in mismatched fabric who comforts her.</p><p>If the heroes have earned the support of @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.WirKAYn5ZGirmgjb], they’ve met Dorianna, and they hear about her nightmares from the other children. Otherwise, the mayor seeks out whichever hero is best known as a healer or as an authority on Occultism. He mentions his daughter’s nightmares and the “motley man” who acts as a protector and savior within them. He asks them to discreetly look into the matter and help his daughter.</p><h3>Asking Wrin</h3><p>Mayor Menhemes views @UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.raJDQ95RBqeXxV14] of Wrin’s Wonders as an unreliable eccentric, so he doesn’t think to involve her in his family’s troubles. However, she’s an expert in Occultism; she gladly accompanies the heroes to help Dorianna if they ask, so long as she doesn’t need to meet with the beleaguered girl indoors. If the party lacks someone with Occultism training to get to the bottom of these mysteries, Wrin’s involvement is a possible solution.</p><h2>Examining Dorianna</h2><p>Even the first time the heroes examine Dorianna, she already appears gaunt and pale as if she had caught a severe malady. A character who succeeds at a @Check[type:medicine|dc:15]{Medicine} check verifies that she’s nevertheless in good physical health. The heroes initially find no evidence of any magic or curse upon her. A search of Dorianna’s room discovers that several of her childhood toys have been brought back out for her to play with. Dorianna states vaguely that she just missed them and wanted to play with them again. Dorianna’s nightmares are tenacious; any magic the heroes use to help Dorianna get a good night’s sleep fail unless the caster succeeds at a secret DC27 Counteract check.</p><h3>XP Award</h3><p>Award the heroes 30 XP for taking the care and time to help Dorianna, even if they can’t figure out what’s wrong just yet.</p><h2>Dorianna’s Decline</h2><p>Dorianna’s condition worsens over time. Her nightmares lessen in intensity, but she feels exhausted and anxious during the day. She begins to talk with the Motley Man as an imaginary friend even when awake, eschewing activities with anyone else. Her disposition becomes erratic and childish, and she often scratches absently at her right hand. Her siblings don’t want anything to do with her, and even her parents find her hard to put up with. She’s been afflicted by Ysondkhelir’s outcast’s curse spell, which the heroes might detect or remove normally. If they do, Ysondkhelir casts it on her again the following night.</p><p>With a successful @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:26]{Diplomacy} check, the heroes gain Dorianna’s trust and get her to open up to them. If they have the support of Menhemes Manor, they have a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Only one hero can attempt this check each day (on a critical failure, they must instead wait [[/r 1d4]] days). On a success, Dorianna insists that the Motley Man is real and discusses one of the following two subjects with them (on a subsequent day’s success or an initial critical success, she reveals both).</p><dl><dt><p>Gifts</p></dt><dd><p>The Motley Man gives her gifts in the form of her old childhood toys, and the best of them is the stuffed griffon. Even a cursory examination reveals that something hard is sewn inside the stuffed toy; characters who open it up find a large, flawless ruby worth 30 gp. Even if the heroes take this ruby, the next time Dorianna dreams, it reappears inside another childhood toy from wherever it is. It’s keyed to Dorianna and doesn’t leave her for long.</p></dd><dt><p>Wrist Writing</p></dt><dd><p>Dorianna absently points out several bruises on her right wrist that she can’t remember getting. A hero trained in Occultism who views the bruises can attempt a @Check[type:occultism|dc:22|traits:action:decipher-writing]{Occultism} check to Decipher Writing. A hero who speaks Aklo gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check. On a success, the hero notes that the words are related to some dream-traveling rituals; on a critical success, the hero notes the word “Leng” among the bruises.</p></dd></dl><p>Either of these clues points to the involvement of a malevolent extraplanar creature called a denizen of Leng. Leng is a terrifying extraplanar location just past the Dimension of Dreams, where cruel and sinister people called denizens of Leng live. A hero who succeeds at a @Check[type:occultism|dc:24|traits:action:recall-knowledge]{Occultism} check realizes the nature of the creature plaguing Dorianna; if the heroes obtained both clues, then any hero trained in Occultism realizes this without a check. Though the heroes might identify the source of Dorianna’s trouble, there’s not much they can do for her yet, because Ysondkhelir doesn’t ever physically get anywhere near her.</p><h3>XP Award</h3><p>Award the heroes 80 XP if they discover a denizen of Leng is involved in Dorianna's malady.</p>"

The manor’s eastern wing contains a public museum of the town’s history. Although this museum contains replicas of the Roseguard’s adventuring gear and even a few common items that the adventurers once owned, the specific icons Otari Ilvashti’s ghost described to the heroes aren’t here. Mayor Oseph Menhemes, Vandy Banderdash at the @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.AztvvKcx7K7gOXhN], or Wrin Sivinxi at @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.jlb4fsKQC57ZjNQ7] can point the heroes in the right direction.</p><h2>Retrieving the Icons</h2><h3>The Hunter's Brooch</h3><p>Aesephna Menhemes’s brooch is in a locked shadowbox in the music room of Menhemes Manor. If the heroes honestly and openly tell Oseph Menhemes why they need it, he permits them to borrow the brooch for as long as they’d like.

While the fire distracted the staff, he broke the Cooperative Blade’s display case and fled with the sword.</p><p>After an hour, the staff had put out the fire without any serious injuries and only a few lost books—a miracle the acolytes attribute to Sarenrae’s protection. By the time anyone discovered the theft, Carman was already on his way to a local cave called @UUID[JournalEntry.VZzXckXM0uJEIc00]. It didn’t take long for the town guard to realize that the missing Carman Rajani was the prime suspect. He had pestered the mayor about the sword for years, after all, and a few witnesses saw someone matching his description absconding from the library, clutching his cloak over some long object.</p><h3>Vandy's Request</h3><p>Vandy Banderdash, head priestess of the Dawnflower Library, meets with the heroes when they come to ask about the sword. She can barely contain her rage, although she seems more angry about the theft than the fire. She asks them to find Carman and bring him in alive to face trial and receive an appropriate punishment.</p><h2>Finding Carman</h2><p>Finding Carman shouldn’t be too hard, as he acted hastily and didn’t have time to cover his tracks or prepare a good cover story. Below are some of the locations they may think to look- the information they find should eventually lead them to @UUID[JournalEntry.VZzXckXM0uJEIc00].</p><h3>Otari Guard</h3><p>The @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.St1SBR4xOInfNoPj] can’t provide much help; Captain Longsaddle points out that since Carman isn’t in town or along the roads, the guards don’t have jurisdiction to pursue him. He harrumphs and adds, “Good riddance to that troublemaker. He’ll keep running if he knows what’s good for him.” He doesn’t provide any aid to capture Carman but happily takes him into custody if the heroes bring the smith into town.</p><h3>Blades for Glades</h3><p>The heroes find Carman’s blacksmith shop, @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.5yYs7JNliPnSYLhp], closed; they won’t find any clues here. If the heroes already had the support of Blades for Glades, they recall that Carman mentioned Smuggler’s Refuge in the past, so it’s a likely hideout.</p><h3>Combing the Town</h3><p>If the heroes ask about Carman’s location in Otari, nearly everyone suggests they go to the Crook’s Nook. A hero who succeeds at a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:20|traits:action:gather-information]{Diplomacy} to Gather Information hears about the Smuggler’s Refuge from townsfolk and recalls that Carman spent time there in his youth (as did many people in Otari).</p><h3>Crook's Nook</h3><p>Asking around at the @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.sdNti6BHkPTeO5fC] brings the owner, Yinyasmera, over to talk. She brazenly asks for a 10 gp “special fee” for food and drinks; heroes who pay up (or succeed at a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:20|traits:action:request]{Diplomacy} to Request information) get her to open up about Carman. The blacksmith has been a little too bold to remain in her good graces, and this theft is the last straw. She mentions that Carman has likely gone into hiding at @UUID[JournalEntry.VZzXckXM0uJEIc00] outside of town. If Yinyasmera has a favorable opinion of the heroes from their previous actions, she gives this information for free.</p>"

The Motley Man told her they would soon be together on their adventures forever, but he wanted her right hand as a token.

But perhaps they thoughtfully debate the issue or even seek other opinions. NPCs in Otari are split on the matter.</p><p><strong>Vandy Banderdash</strong> thinks it’s wrong to bargain with a devil using another person’s soul. She believes that everyone deserves a chance at redemption, even Carman. However, she holds a particular contempt for thieves, as she never really recovered from the betrayal of her sister stealing from her years ago. She doesn’t push the heroes if they disagree with her.</p><p><strong>Wrin Sivinxi</strong> also opposes the deal since she finds limiting a soul’s freedom to be abhorrent.</p><p><strong>Captain Longsaddle</strong> happily releases Carman to the heroes so they can turn him over to the devil. He considers this choice a straightforward way to eliminate a serious threat to his town.</p><p>For once, <strong>Yinyasmera </strong>agrees with the guard captain. She’s had so many past problems with Carman that she’d also like to see him gone, especially knowing that doing so would save the town.</p><p><strong>Mayor Oseph Menhemes</strong> doesn’t take a position but backs whatever choice the heroes make, especially if they’ve been helping his daughter. The mayor believes that the heroes are capable and trustworthy decision-makers. If his opinion serves as a tie-breaker, he leans toward showing Carman mercy.</p><p><strong>Morlibint </strong>doesn’t offer a direct opinion but recommends several stories about dealing with devils (virtually all of which turn out very poorly for the mortals involved).</p><h2>Recovering Carman</h2><p>How easily the heroes can recover Carman depends on his fate in Chapter 5. If they released him, the heroes likely find him still brooding in Smuggler’s Refuge, as he hasn’t yet summoned the courage to depart. He certainly won’t go with the heroes willingly if they explain what they want with him, but the heroes could trick him. If Carman knows what he’s in for, he does his best to flee the area, and the heroes probably have to work with Urevian to scry his new location—which the contract devil certainly makes them pay for, one way or another.</p><p>If Carman is in jail, the heroes can simply fetch him from custody. Longsaddle doesn’t mind turning him over to the heroes, as they captured him in the first place. If they’re up-front about why they want Carman, he’s surprisingly agreeable to turning the scoundrel over to the devil.</p><p>If Carman is dead, the heroes must go to the place of his death to trap his spirit. Urevian explains that the heroes must perform the @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gsYEuWv04XTDxe91]{Call Spirit} ritual (which he can teach them) while holding a specially-prepared gemstone (that he also provides). The heroes are responsible for performing the ritual and paying its cost. If they call Carman’s spirit, it’s automatically drawn into the gemstone.</p><h3>Delivery</h3><p>If the heroes bring Carman Rajani to Urevian alive or give him a soul gem with Carman’s soul inside, Urevian flicks a hand toward his desk. All the contents magically pack themselves into smaller and smaller boxes, eventually into a single valise that one of the barbazus picks up. The other barbazu takes Carman (or the gem) in a firm grip, and both barbazus disappear. “It was a pleasure doing business with you,” says Urevian, “I will look you up again, perhaps in a few years or decades. And if you have died in that time... well, I can come find you anyway. You are so delightfully useful. I shall be in touch.”</p><h3>XP Award</h3><p>Award the heroes 120 XP if they make a deal with Urevian and get the devil to depart.</p>"

Since her return, she has taken measures to renew their allegiance to her- but how did she earn it to begin with?</p><h3>The Urdefhan Cult</h3><p>Urdefhans are vampire-like humanoids who largely pursue lives of violence and slaughter. As brutal killers obsessed with ending life and existence itself, the urdefhans who regularly emerged from their caves to raid the caverns and lake of the Hunting Grounds were precisely the kind of soldiers Belcorra needed for her campaign. She made a calculated, overwhelming attack to awe the urdefhans, and when the sorcerer called for a parley, the urdefhan war champion listened. Belcorra swore the urdefhans would be the vanguard of her eventual assault on the surface and gave the Emerald Fulcrum Lens to the war champion as a token of her favor until then. Generations passed, and the war champions passed down the fulcrum lens as their symbol of leadership.</p><h3>Drow Allegiance</h3><p>With the deep gnomes cowed and the urdefhans awed by her power, Belcorra next turned to the drow of the Hunting Grounds. From their secure stronghold of Yldaris, the drow ranged through the caverns like deadly apparitions, retreating in the face of significant danger. Belcorra knew that she must trap the drow into an alliance, so she captured and imprisoned more and more of their hunters until Yldaris’s leader agreed to meet with her. She traded the captives for a promise that the drow would keep the Ochre Fulcrum Lens safe and provide aid in her attack on the surface.</p><h2>Oaths Renewed</h2><p>When Belcorra arose as a ghost, she visited the Hunting Grounds first. She checked her treasure vault to ensure its most important contents remained secure and then sent the vault’s @UUID[Actor.oXnpdJVN6NIE58W3] guardian to retrieve the valuable books she’d left on an upper level. She next visited the urdefhans, who still told vague legends of the quasi-mythical sorcerer. Their new war champion, @UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.5s8hYZ6UPLJW5dtd], carried the Emerald Fulcrum Lens and agreed to follow their Ghost Queen to raze the surface world. The urdefhans have since stepped up their summoning of daemon allies, preparing for the pending assault.</p><p>Belcorra’s visit to the drow of Yldaris went less well. @UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.PMfMv2GzieXiY1Oo], the granddaughter of the leader from whom Belcorra extracted a promise to serve, had little idea who Belcorra was. Still, Belcorra nevertheless accepted Quara’s hastily-given (and not entirely genuine) renewal of her grandfather’s promise.</p>"

She dubbed these loyal, diminutive gardeners the Children of Belcorra.</p><p>The Children of Belcorra disbelieved rumors of Belcorra’s death as some sort of trick or test and didn’t waver in their duties. But as the years passed, more and more feral monsters made their way into the level and made their mission in the farm more difficult. Believing that Belcorra (or, perhaps, some other Haruvex) would return, the Children chose to become undead to combat their dwindling numbers and increasing age. They immured each other in the muddy shores to rise again as bog mummies or undertook difficult transformations into other, more powerful, undead.</p><p>Eventually, their timeless lives and lack of direction took their toll. Many Children fell into a torpor or retreated into obsession or isolation. The farm they’d carefully tended became infested with monsters and subterranean explorers, such as calignis, drow, and urdefhans.</p><section class=\"npc\"><article><h2>Vethris</h2><p class=\"stats\">Female Spirit Naga 9</p></article></section><p>Even Belcorra’s return as the Ghost Queen couldn’t quite energize all of the Children of Belcorra to action, but many realized how much they’d failed their charge.

She placed the Children under the command of a new supervisor, a dark naga named @UUID[Actor.h4SZ3U9at7aT0ASv], but chose poorly; the naga is corrupt, lazy, and more interested in her creature comforts than guiding the deep gnome undead in their tasks.</p><p>The Children of Belcorra aren’t happy with the naga’s indolence but are reluctant to contradict their Ghost Queen.

Their two leaders—a spellcaster named Galudu and a warrior named Dulac—led them into the safety of an old lodge in the Hunting Grounds level. From there, the calignis explored upward, reaching an abandoned shrine of Nhimbaloth and eventually discovering a gug mystic named Urthagul. Urthagul laired in a cave resonating with strange psychic whispers that awed the calignis. Some of the calignis, led by Dulac, revered the gug and his eerie visions; others remained skeptical of Urthagul’s powers. This ultimately resulted in a schism: the self-named Cult of Urthagul inhabits the shrine, and Galudu’s calignis reside in the @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc.JournalEntryPage.VhKqePYVA3INg8gz] below. The two groups aren’t enemies, but they only rarely interact.</p></article><figure><img class=\"flipx\" style=\"padding:0 10px\" src=\"modules/pf2e-abomination-vaults/assets/bestiary-portraits/ch-09/galudu.webp\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption>@UUID[Actor.3Ll0LCZcmQmb7aV3]</figcaption></figure></section><h2>Dulac's Group</h2><p>The Cult of Urthagul has grown increasingly insular and zealous. (Urthagul, for his part, hardly even noticed their presence, much less their worship.) The calginis hunt chuul eggs from the lake, ritually cooking and consuming them as part of their strange rites. Dulac and her second-in-command, Padli, have both gained occult powers from meditating on the whispers in Urthagul’s cave, which they use to keep the cult in line.</p><p>When Belcorra awakened, she visited the shrine to Nhimbaloth and was surprised to find the calignis there. She visited with Urthagul and found that the gug’s strange behavior wasn’t only due to the psychic emanations of the cave, but also because the gug had found the Crimson Fulcrum Lens and communed with the splinter of Nhimbaloth’s essence inside it. Belcorra realized the lens was probably safe in the gug’s claws, but she didn’t want it to end up in the hands of some interloper cult she didn’t have the time or desire to deal with. She tasked her wisp minions to keep the calignis contained within their shrine.</p><p>It frustrates the cult to be apart from the object of their veneration.

Instead, flickerwisps subsist on confusion and doubt. The sense of unease a traveler exudes when they become lost in the woods is flickerwisps' favorite repast. They can sip from this sense of disorientation without betraying their presence or harming their prey. Eventually, the flickerwisps grow too hungry and are compelled to flit closer, confuse their prey, and glut on the raw emotions. Flickerwisps do their best to swoop away before death occurs, and the most skilled of these tormentors can keep a chosen meal alive for days, sipping from confusion in small doses.</p>",

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p><p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p><p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>",

With the slurk's natural ability to climb walls and cling effortlessly to ceilings, it can be easy for unwary cave explorers to end up on the wrong end of these formidable ivory tusks.</p><p>Slurks exude two very different types of foul-smelling secretions from their pale white skin. Large pustules on the slurk's back drip a sticky resin-like slime that quickly hardens upon exposure to air. By flexing its skin, the slurk can burst these pustules in the direction of intruders, covering its foes in sticky goo and severely limiting their ability to withstand the monster's other attacks, including the effects of its other secretion. Glands along the slurk's ventral side excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added benefit of making it extremely difficult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where slurks rest between meals.</p><p>Slurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals. Despite this apparent failure, others who live underground often befriend slurks. The sticky frog-beasts have proven extremely desirable to kobolds (page 210), who now domesticate and train slurks as powerful mounts and guardians. While other creatures, particularly boggards, sometimes train slurks to serve as guardians, kobolds remain those who use these creatures the most. A kobold mounted on a slurk will often hide in the upper ledges of a cave, using the advantages of height and surprise to harry foes with ranged attacks. Kobold riders also take advantage of the slurk's ability to climb, and charge at their enemies from the walls of a cavern.</p>",

Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally-certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.</p><p>When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.</p><p>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.</p>",

With an amorphous body that consists as much of fluid as it does of air, these creatures dwell in swamps or moist underground regions where their vulnerability to heat isn't as much of a concern. Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas, as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these sadistic monsters vastly prefer the flavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures. Like will-o'-wisps, vampiric mists find that fear flavors the blood, though they gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.</p><p>Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey-a pursuit they approach with great creativity. The mists' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish tactics-such as tricking spellcasters into attempting to use vitality energy against them as if they were undead monsters.</p>",

While smaller than most drakes, river drakes are more than capable of plaguing river travelers and are equally at home above and below the water's surface. This flexibility allows them to catch a wide variety of prey, from fish and boggards to deer and the occasional ferry passenger.</p><hr /><p>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct, drakes are draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of the primal dragons they share evolutionary roots with. While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.</p><p>Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thickscaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.</p><p>Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them.</p><h3>Drake Eggs</h3><p>While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.</p><p>A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.</p><p>A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a @Check[nature|dc:20] check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.</p><p>Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see. A creature imprinted on in this way can use Nature to Train and Command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the type of drake and the exact legal situation. Because drakes are dangerous and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.</p><p>It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges.</p>",

Cultists of Haagenti typically use grothluts as guardians that slowly patrol the edges of their enclaves. Once in position, grothluts can be used as crude shock troops, unleashed to soften enemy forces before more valuable warriors wade in and cut down the enemies who have been nauseated by the grothluts' exploded organs and flesh.</p><hr /><p>Magical mishaps, divine curses, and untested technology are all capable of wreaking drastic transformations on the body, and are all rampant on the world of Golarion and beyond. Creatures that have undergone changes so drastic they no longer can be considered the same ancestry as they were before are known as fleshwarps. These beings are rare, and their unsettling appearance often provokes horrified responses from other people.</p><p>Some creatures revel in the total degradation of their defeated foes through fleshwarping. Though the technique was originally taught to mortals by the demon lord Haagenti, mortals have spent eons modifying and perfecting the method.

The same oil coats the scalathrax's body, all of which is quite flammable-whether it's coating a victim or the scalathrax itself.</p><p>While a scalathrax appears feral, it's more intelligent than it seems and is capable of speaking in a wet, slithery voice. The vast majority of scalathraxes are foul-tempered and quick to anger, and most of them enjoy killing. It's possible to forge an alliance with a scalathrax, but doing so requires either constant bribes of new creatures to kill or a particularly intimidating personality-scalathraxes often respect bullies, seeing in them a mirror of their own cruel values.</p>",

With a nominal intelligence, gibbering mouthers can understand and even speak Aklo, but they do so in an intelligible manner only rarely. Instead, their innumerable mouths constantly jabber and babble in a stream of sound that disrupts the thought patterns of other creatures in the area.</p><p>Where, how, and why gibbering mouthers originated are questions without answers. They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal's attempt to create something akin to a shoggoth-though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little to say on the matter-at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers' noises-studies that put researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best.</p><p>Whatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion. Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv. They are somewhat less common in the upper region of Nar-Voth, perhaps due to the prevalence of settlements that don't tolerate gibbering mouthers' presence.</p>",

It's less common for wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don't bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids often feel when facing a carrion or flesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic match between the wood golem's appearance and such locations.</p><hr /><p>The shape and structure of a golem are limited only by the power and creativity of its crafter.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible}, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p><p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact, lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p><p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden, stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>",

Folklore holds that, much like the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk's physiology lends any credence to this claim.</p><p>A basilisk prefers to eat petrified flesh. Once a victim has been turned to stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow and inefficient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as if in mid-petrification itself. This has even led to the saying \"as slow as a well-fed basilisk.\" Certainly, basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed.</p><p>An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turn to a guttural gurgle when they're agitated.</p><p>Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these unusual congregations of basilisk activity is a mystery.</p><p>For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other materials, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.</p>",

Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict sadistic suffering.

Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp-the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.</p><p>Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city's periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.</p><p>Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider's innate spells remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider presented below.</p><hr /><p>Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies. They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying transformative technique known as fleshwarping. Though the fleshwarping process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their flesh and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of flesh results in countless variations of fleshwarps, and the following are just a couple of examples of these horrors.</p>",

In their journey below, they fell to bickering and in-fighting, drawing the attention of sinister intelligences beyond their own. Whether it was the influence of a specific demon lord, the Rough Beast Rovagug, or some other fell force is unknown, but in that time the elves transformed both spiritually and physically, tainting their hearts with desires for cruelty, sadism, and violence. The hues of their eyes became sinister red or bleached white, and their flesh adopted an unearthly lavender sheen that made the drow instantly recognizable. The drow also developed potent magical abilities and resistances that further empowered them, if at the cost of their souls.</p><p>Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently dysfunctional society, influenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a specific demon lord patron-but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn't simply consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one's superior-be it a teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships-is the real bond holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike.</p><p>The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends crafted to share around a campfire. Today, the existence of drow is an understood truth, and while their presence in the dark caverns deep below is unsettling, they seem content to leave the surface world alone for now.</p>",

Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.</p><hr /><p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p><p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p><p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp-the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.</p><p>Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city's periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.</p><p>Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider's innate spells remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider presented below.</p><hr /><p>Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies. They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying transformative technique known as fleshwarping. Though the fleshwarping process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their flesh and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of flesh results in countless variations of fleshwarps, and the following are just a couple of examples of these horrors.</p>",

While skulks see themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared purpose for very long.</p><p>Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around sewers and the like, are skulks' favorite stomping grounds.

They serve as guardians of the Academy of Lies—the repository of secrets in Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell. Sarglagons breathe water and air with equal ease, and can move through water, land, and even air with uncanny swiftness. Few fiends travel the waterways of the multiverse, but where a river crosses the planes, odds are sarglagons have traveled it to further their infernal machinations. The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the fiends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway's memory-sapping qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes bind sarglagons as guardians of precious secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic areas. Most strangely, sarglagons sometimes act as unnerving caretakers to mortals who have no idea what they did to earn their unwanted protectors' attention. The constant uninvited vigilance of these devils is often disturbing and stifling to their wards.</p><hr /><p>Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks.</p><p>Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly orts perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as infantry and contract devils, while the greatest nessaris command entire infernal armies.</p><p>Asmodeus stands at the apex of the structure he created, but the layers below him are marked by a constant jockeying for position. Most diabolic plans ultimately serve to improve the schemer's place in the hierarchy.</p>",

Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.</p><p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p><p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p><p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.</p><p>Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.</p>",

Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.</p><p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p><p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p><p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.</p><p>Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.</p>",

Their preferred method of hunting is by lunging out of the water, paralyzing their victims with their poison-coated tentacles, then gleefully dragging their twitching food into the water to drown if they cannot simply eat such morsels alive. Chuuls that dwell aboveground prefer to dine on lizardfolk, while those swimming the subterranean lakes of the Darklands readily eat anything but xulgaths, whose flavor and stink they find off-putting.</p><p>Chuuls are capable of speech and reason, but these creatures rarely speak with those outside their species except to taunt their food. Before it begins consuming its prey, a chuul often speaks in a gurgling, nearly incomprehensible dialect about how it will enjoy feasting on the creature's flesh. Perhaps chuuls believe that insults and degradation lead to more tender and tastier food, but the truth will likely never be known; almost all chuuls stubbornly refuse any meaningful conversation, even when imprisoned and compelled by treats or pain.</p><p>It is unknown if a chuul society exists beyond their frenzied mating season. Chuuls' intellects seem devoted only toward eating, causing psychological pain to sentient creatures, decorating their lairs with mementos of their favorite meals and victories, and breeding.</p>",

A voracious but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed. The drakauthix's digestive process is entirely external-it clings to victims, and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow.</p><p>The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals, and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn't above feasting on more active prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.</p><p>Some Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for their flesh, which has a unique flavor with a peppery aftertaste. Subterranean races also make ink from drakauthixes by burning their carcasses, then grinding and pressing the ashes for a long time until a silvery substance congeals.</p>",

While they are known to hunt and eat crocodiles, alligators, and virtually any creature with flesh, their favorite prey are lizardfolk, boggards, and dinosaurs.</p><p>Krooths are found alone or in packs. Male krooths are solitary and territorial creatures—fierce, bold, and bloodthirsty. Female krooths, on the other hand, are more likely to shy away from potential predators but swiftly turn violent when their brood is threatened. Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths gather in packs to raise their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food while the rest of the pack watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4 or 5 years, and the mating process is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire pack of females will hunt as a group for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize in a frenzy that can last for an entire day and night. After the mating has finished, the females slay their mate and devour his nutrientrich flesh, and his organs in particular. These organs contain a unique chemical compound vital to gestation. Many naturalists will pay handsomely for the fresh remains of a male krooth so they can study the strange properties of the creature's blood and organs. In addition, krooths have poisonous, hollow teeth. When these creatures bite their prey, a tooth breaks off and causes the victim to bleed profusely as their blood pours through the hollow tooth.</p><p>Whether male or female, krooths seem to be repelled by goblinoid flesh, especially that of bugbears. This doesn't mean krooths won't kill goblinoids, especially those threatening their young, but they typically do so using only their claws and tails, and they take great care to clean themselves thoroughly after such a killing.</p>",

More often than not, these despicable manipulators wish to drive their victims into madness and even to suicide. Most niliths lack the patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its flesh and moving onto the next victim.</p><p>Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant dimension beyond dreams—in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding machines for the unknown alien entities to which they are connected.

Indeed, many who investigate the nature of a nilith's bond are driven to madness before getting anywhere close. The odd connection to otherworldly beings might help explain the longevity of these creatures, as it is believed that niliths can live for thousands of years.</p><p>Thankfully for others, niliths are solitary creatures that hate the company of their own kind, likely because these harbingers of nightmares have no wish to taste the horrors they bring to others.</p>",

Cunning and patient ambush predators, ropers use this to their advantage.</p><p>Ropers do not form large societies (although they can often be found living alongside other deep-dwelling denizens), but they often congregate in small clusters and sometimes hunt in groups. Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper's appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, the ropers' appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity-especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers' wits and patience. A roper is 9 feet tall and weighs 2,200 pounds.</p>",

Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.</p><p>The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order-or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.</p><hr /><p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p><p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p><p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Unlike some daemons, derghodaemons derive little pleasure from prolonged deaths-to these fiends, the quicker they can enact a gory demise, the sooner they can turn their attentions to their next victim and repeat the violent cycle.</p><p>Derghodaemons look like walking masses of razor-sharp insect claws connected to equally menacing chitinous limbs, but few linger on their appearance for long- the gaze of a derghodaemon is enough to cause others in the vicinity to experience severe visual warping. The derghodaemon's appearance becomes more and more twisted as those who stare at it experience vicious hallucinations and ravenous urges to inflict harm on and devour others. Perhaps the most horrific attack derghodaemons can unleash upon their victims, though, is their swarming infestation-the daemons cough up a crawling, buzzing cloud of ravenous insects that cling to those targeted and chew them to death, provided the mind-numbing, half-whispered threats made by the rasp of the insects' bodies don't drive them to violent fury first!</p>",

Thees drow rely on awareness and adaptation to survive the cutthroat nature of their society.</p><hr /><p>The first drow were elves who fled into the depths of the world from a devastating cataclysm thousands of years ago. In their journey below, they fell to bickering and in-fighting, drawing the attention of sinister intelligences beyond their own. Whether it was the influence of a specific demon lord, the Rough Beast Rovagug, or some other fell force is unknown, but in that time the elves transformed both spiritually and physically, tainting their hearts with desires for cruelty, sadism, and violence. The hues of their eyes became sinister red or bleached white, and their flesh adopted an unearthly lavender sheen that made the drow instantly recognizable. The drow also developed potent magical abilities and resistances that further empowered them, if at the cost of their souls.</p><p>Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently dysfunctional society, influenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a specific demon lord patron-but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn't simply consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one's superior-be it a teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships-is the real bond holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike.</p><p>The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends crafted to share around a campfire. Today, the existence of drow is an understood truth, and while their presence in the dark caverns deep below is unsettling, they seem content to leave the surface world alone for now.</p>",

Their hatred for other creatures is as acidic as their breath weapons, and they rarely tolerate even other dragons of their kind-except perhaps to mate or temporarily collaborate to take down a mutual enemy.</p><p>Black dragons are amphibious-although they breathe air, their gills also allow them to breathe water.

The floors are littered with rotting meat, and plundered treasures line the muck and slime of their dank caves amid twisted roots and creepers. Such places are often crawling with pests, snakes, and slimes. Though they claim natural caverns when they can, they make do with areas of dense, twisted vegetation within a swamp. Black dragon treasure hoards primarily consist of gems and expensive glass work, as valuables of softer substance can't survive the dragon's acidic presence.</p><hr /><p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

Shulns grow to about 20 feet long and have four tiny, nearly imperceptible eyes; a long, pale snout; four thick-muscled legs that end in long, serrated claws; and a stubby pink tail. As a young shuln matures, its unique metabolism produces adamantine that becomes infused throughout its skeletal system. In addition to making their claws and fangs nearly unbreakable, this unique physiological trait makes shulns unparalleled burrowers and highly sought by monster hunters who hope to harvest the precious material from their corpses.</p><p>Shulns have a ravenous appetite and eat nearly anything they can catch, but their preferred diet consists almost entirely of large invertebrates, especially cave worms. They rely on tiny sensory whiskers that cover their snouts and allow them to detect subtle movements in the air and ground without the use of vision. When they detect suitable prey, shulns bite their target at the first opportunity, injecting it with a potent paralytic toxin present in their saliva. So strong is this poison that it's capable of subduing even the near-unstoppable cave worm, making shulns a valuable (if dangerous) companion to anyone making excursions into worm-infested regions of the Darklands. Shulns' notoriously ill-tempered dispositions and their knack for digging into areas of an underground settlement where digging ought not to occur make them frustrating creatures to keep around, but when the alternative is an unpredictable but deadly visit from an enormous, hungry cave worm, the annoyances are well worth the trouble.</p><p>Encounters with much larger shuln-like entities on the Plane of Earth suggest that these creatures may have originated from there. The larger shulns still retain their elemental qualities, are quite a bit smarter, and have their own suite of earth-themed innate primal spells—but for all that, they still love the taste of cave worm.</p>",

She learns about them from her wisp allies and you can thereafter use her whenever her appearance might cause the most tension. She should attack at least once on each dungeon level, as often as every couple of days. You shouldn't have Belcorra fight alongside other creatures until the adventure's finale-she's tough enough on her own!</p><p>Each time Belcorra attacks, she learns more about how the heroes fight and adapts her tactics and her preparations. She might cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.tgIhRUFtgDSELpJE] to protect herself from the heroes' most effective spells, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.uqlxMQQeSGWEVjki] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.jwK43yKsHTkJQvQ9] to keep them in sight, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG] to counter their magical defenses. She mocks the heroes for their failures and rages at their successes-remember, she has been aware of them since her test firing of <em>Gauntlight's</em> beam in \"Ruins of Gauntlight.\"</p><p><strong>First Attack</strong> As soon as Belcorra realizes the heroes' presence, she seeks them out, traveling through the <em>Gauntlight</em> footprint (areas <strong>A37</strong> and <strong>B28</strong>). She casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.0XP2XOxT9VSiXFDr] at a distance and retreats, moving through walls if necessary so the heroes can't follow.</p><p><strong>Second Attack</strong> Belcorra wants the heroes to fear her, so she approaches them more closely the second time and uses single-target spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5BbU1V6wGSGbrmRD] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.tlcrVRqW1MSKJ5IC] while demanding the heroes flee her Abomination Vaults. With her message delivered, she retreats after only a few rounds.</p><p><strong>Later Attacks</strong> Once the heroes have recovered a <em>fulcrum lens</em> or the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.JwHNSaiwwqF7VCC5]</em>, Belcorra considers the heroes an actual threat, but her anger overrides her caution. She attacks with her full might, using her Corrupting Gaze and ghostly hand along with her spells. If she defeats a hero, she retreats, confident that they'll leave her alone.</p><p><strong>Leveraging Agents</strong> Belcorra has several living allies within the Abomination Vaults, including the urdefhan cult and the Children of Belcorra. She might send these groups after the heroes, insisting they let the heroes know they're acting on Belcorra's orders. Fortunately, neither group can muster large numbers, so the heroes should be able to manage an attack from them.</p><p><strong>Killing Allies</strong> Belcorra learns if the heroes make alliances, such as with nearby calignis or drow. She knows better than to face powerful, entrenched leaders like Galudu or Quara, but she might murder a few guards or direct monsters where they can most damage the heroes' allies. It's important to Belcorra that she leave some evidence (usually a single, injured survivor) to let the heroes know she had orchestrated the attack.</p><p><strong>In the Footprint</strong> Belcorra is most effective fighting the heroes who enter the <em>Gauntlight</em> footprint (areas <strong>A37</strong> and <strong>B28</strong>) due to her Haunted Lighthouse ability.</p><p><strong>The Final Attack</strong> If the heroes defeat Belcorra shortly before they reach the Empty Vault, she uses the power of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.CTiLugp5ptSItEqN]</em> to hasten her rejuvenation so she can face them in her sanctum. Belcorra doesn't ever surrender or flee in the Empty Vault. The heroes could possibly face her there without yet having the ability to permanently defeat her. In this case, they'll need to retreat to collect the <em>fulcrum lenses</em> and return to face her again. Once the heroes can focus Nhimbaloth's gaze upon Belcorra, they can defeat the sorcerer for good.</p>",

Despite their size, they move with incredible alacrity, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs without pause. Though they are formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful ranged attack. These creatures can pelt their opponents by forcefully regurgitating gastroliths-melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive enzymes strong enough to break down flesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.</p><p>While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait. They have been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.</p><p>For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough food to sustain a community tends to be difficult. However, they still maintain a sense of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces are usually nebulous.</p>",

They're often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn't adversely impact the golems' functionality.</p><p>Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in size-most are Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.</p><hr /><p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p><p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p><p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.</p><p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p><p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p><p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size.

These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.</p>",
