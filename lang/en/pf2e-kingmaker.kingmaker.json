Even as the PCs gain their first footholds in the wilds, plans beyond their borders and outside their knowledge have already been set into motion. Others, including the Tiger Lord barbarians, the expansionist @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.UG1YQsZGkWshc4AY] of Pitax, the sinister cult of Lamashtu, and the undead cyclops @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK], each have their own designs on the region. Unknown to them all, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.vtrUtpKwKZVyLdLD] waits and watches, eager for one group to seize control and establish the last kingdom she requires to satiate the @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.3pWxyt1JN8VaDS2y]’s rage.</p><p>While most of these machinations are destined to remain isolated and at odds for a while, two emerging threats confront the PCs sooner than the others: the troll king @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.mcnuxpRVYOo6gRYn] and an enormous owlbear—both indirectly influenced by Nyrissa as early tests to ensure that the PCs’ kingdom will have the mettle she needs when the time comes to harvest her final nation.</p><h3>Hargulka</h3><p>Even before Restov took an official interest in the lands to the south, lone hunters, trappers, and loggers made their presence felt in the forests of the Stolen Lands. To Nyrissa, these newcomers, along with the land’s indigenous residents (including kobolds, lizardfolk, and a handful of good-aligned—and thus untrustworthy—fey) had far too much independence for her liking. So she visited the troll @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.mcnuxpRVYOo6gRYn] in a dream, planting in his mind ideas of territorial expansion and aggression and tricking him into thinking he wanted to claim more power. Hargulka abandoned his original den and moved into an abandoned dwarven fort in the southern Stolen Lands, using it as a base to gather power and stage raids against the intelligent denizens of the area. As this chapter progresses, Hargulka’s minions and other denizens of the southern Greenbelt grow increasingly violent, attacking travelers and terrorizing locals. By manipulating the troll into destabilizing the region, Nyrissa hopes to make the lands easier to claim when the time comes.</p><h3>The Beast</h3><p>The Stag Lord’s bandits were also influenced by Nyrissa, but they were not the first group of brigands she manipulated. Before them, Nyrissa had targeted a group led by a ruthless hunter named Eirikk, a man who made extensive use of trained and untrained (but mostly loyal) wild animals and monsters, using them in frequent attacks on traveling merchants north and west of Hooktongue Slough. This tactic was made possible in most part due to a gift Nyrissa gave Eirikk: a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.xnnVMQZl4i2NuYVe] made from a lock of her hair—a ring that, unknown to Eirikk, bore an unfortunate curse. Just as the Stag Lord later would, Eirikk considered Nyrissa a “secret benefactor” and hoped someday to instead make her his “secret lover.” When she told him about the up-and-coming new nation of merchants expanding quickly in the Greenbelt, and in the same breath casually mentioned a particularly violent mated pair of gigantic owlbears dwelling in the Sellen Hills, Eirikk saw this as an excellent chance to impress the nymph. If he could gain the allegiance of these enormous owlbears and conquer this new kingdom, how could his secret benefactor resist his charms? Certainly, the prospect of switching his predation to a nascent kingdom pleased him, as Fort Drelev’s defenses had grown ever more skilled at repulsing his bandits and trained beasts.</p><p>And so Eirikk led his bandits west into the Narlmarches. He found the male alone in his den and, using the <em>ring of bestial friendship</em>, managed to calm it down enough to make his first attempt at friendship. Then the ring’s curse came into play: the female owlbear returned, sensed the enchantment, and flew into a frenzy. Eirikk and his men were forced to kill it, causing the male to throw off the enchantment. The briefly controlled owlbear killed the entire bandit party, Eirikk included. Yet while the plan ended poorly for Eirikk, everything had gone exactly as Nyrissa had planned—she had never valued the bandit’s skills in the first place and wanted only to incite the massive owlbear into a blood rage. Furious and maddened at the loss of its mate and the wounds it suffered, the enormous owlbear flew into a rampage, and the PCs’ new kingdom and capital city lie right in its path. If these forces are not dealt with, the rivers of the Stolen Lands will run red with the blood of the latest doomed attempt to civilize them!</p>"

Rostland wants a safe southern border and an ally it can count on if things go badly, but it doesn’t want to antagonize its northern counterpart Issia by appearing to make blatant land grabs to expand its power. The backroom politics occurring in Restov as the swordlords covertly attempt to increase their own power continue to be an element as the Kingmaker Adventure Path progresses, manifesting primarily as story-based Kingdom events. Rostland will eventually be forced to cut official ties with the projects it’s starting in the south when Issia begins to react poorly to what northern Brevoy has begun to interpret as an act of aggression. All of this increasingly puts the PCs in charge of their own fates in their newly founded kingdom.</p><p>For now, Lady Jamandi and the rest of Rostland remain supportive of the PCs’ kingdom-building, while remaining relatively hands-off. Full details for how to build a kingdom appear in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7] journal, and you should take time with your players to get things up and running before continuing with the campaign. Feel free to roleplay out as much or as little of the establishment of the kingdom’s charter, heartland, and government as you wish. The sample charter presented as @UUID[JournalEntry.1S5XVzEgRf2MKa6U.JournalEntryPage.4AuDrlNqYwbN9F6F] presents a generic version of the document provided by Lady Jamandi; tailor it for your players as needed.</p><figure class=\"right\"><img width=\"220\" src=\"modules\\pf2e-kingmaker\\assets\\journal-kingdom/crown.webp\" /></figure><h3>Optional Rule: Kingdom In The Background</h3><p>The kingdom- and settlement-building elements of the Kingmaker Adventure Path add a unique spin to the game, both in play and in pacing. As the kingdom grows, the PCs’ responsibility to it increases. Not only do they need to worry about gathering gear and strength for their own adventures, they’ll need to take care of an entire kingdom’s needs. This style of game play isn’t for everyone; you know your players better than we do, and if you’re worried that managing kingdoms and building cities will bore your players (or worse, that it might cause party strife when your players have different levels of interest in this element of game play), consider running Kingmaker as a more standard campaign. In this case, the evolution of the Stolen Lands into a kingdom should happen in the background, with NPCs taking on all of the leadership roles needed to develop the kingdom. This chapter, and those that follow, will have periodic “Kingdom in the Background” sidebars that you can use to track the size of the growing kingdom and the resources it provides for the PCs.</p><p>The pace at which the PCs’ kingdom gains levels should roughly follow the PCs’ own level increases. While the mechanics of kingdom building are self-contained, many events assume that the party’s level and the level of their kingdom are within 2 of each other, if not equal. If you find that the PCs are getting 3 or 4 levels ahead of the kingdom’s level, consider slowing down exploration and encounter play to focus on running several Kingdom turns in succession, allowing the kingdom to catch up.</p><aside><h3>Kingdom in the Background</h3><p>During @UUID[JournalEntry.GciDhpLFRov9s5Fm.JournalEntryPage.FN1VH6Yhlsw01hip], the NPC leaders of the new kingdom decide to call the new nation Narland and establish a capital city named Shrikewall on the north shore of the Tuskwater at the site once used by @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.70FiR5COVuuS28ZD] as a fort. After an initial growth spurt, Shrikewall soon stabilizes as a prosperous small town the PCs can use as a home base or a place to buy and sell gear. Halfway through this adventure, two new settlements appear as well: one to the north around @UUID[JournalEntry.AgbaF8i9XDLEtxqe.JournalEntryPage.fTB6r42OJIsE5Y3e] (a village named Olegton) and one to the west at a ford on the Skunk River deep in the Narlmarches (a village named @UUID[JournalEntry.hg9Bztz48jKxb8K6.JournalEntryPage.H7wXdZVu3jbnZrIk], after the beasts that dwelt in the area until recently).</p></aside>"

Not long after this, as citizens begin to travel to the settlement and settle down into new lives, the PCs learn some unsettling news: just outside the settlement, two unfortunate villagers—a female human farmhand named Saki and a male human shepherd named Beven—were brutally slaughtered on consecutive nights. The villagers ask the PCs to do something, fearing the depredations of bandits or of some beast from the surrounding wilderness. Consider tailoring the personalities and makeup of these villagers such that your PCs will feel a particular need to protect them, as this event should help to set up the PCs as rulers who want to save their people from the dangers of the Stolen Lands. Later, you can have these same villagers play additional roles in the campaign, using them as a springboard to introduce more and more custom NPCs into your game.</p><p>The perpetrator of these slayings is a werewolf, and as such you should time this event to take place just before the last day of the full moon.

The immense owlbear driven to furious rage by the actions of the bandit @UUID[.IMxvfhgelggNFSoC] is poised to lash out at the closest civilization: the PCs’ fledgling kingdom!</p><p>At some point after the PCs return to their capital city (or, at your discretion, any of their settlements located near the giant owlbear’s lair), they’ll be greeted with a horrific sight: buildings and structures in shambles. Newly plowed fields have been torn up, trees have been knocked down, livestock have been slaughtered, and buildings have been flattened. A pall of smoke and dust hangs over the settlement, and the few people left on the streets mill about in shock, as if they have just come from a war zone. Any inquiries are met first with blank stares, but eventually the whole story comes out.</p><p>Several hours before the PCs returned to town, an enormous owlbear attacked it. The locals have already taken to naming the creature after the settlement it attacked, calling it the “Beast of (settlement name).” The creature is referred to simply as the “Beast” in this chapter, but you should personalize it to the name of the settlement it attacked.</p><p>Once the PCs have learned the basics, run the @UUID[.MaPwBxZi6qPpiqXy] story Kingdom event. This event doesn’t progress the timeline of your adventure; play it out in the context of a flashback, giving the PCs the opportunity not just to catch a glimpse of the Beast in action, but also to have an impact on the amount of damage done by the Beast. Build up to the die roll describing images and sounds of chaos and fear among the townsfolk. Don’t be afraid to put some of the players’ favorite NPC citizens in apparent danger; if the event ends in success or better, describe those NPCs playing heroic roles in the aftermath. After the roll, as you describe the event’s outcome, make sure that the PCs’ influence as leaders of the community is part of the story: With success, explain that even while absent, the PCs inspired and influenced the citizens’ response; with failure, describe how the townsfolk sorely missed the PCs’ support on this day.</p><h2>Concluding the Chapter</h2><p>Of all the story-focused chapters in Kingmaker, this one is the most open-ended. There’s no real timeline of threats the PCs need to follow during the course of the adventure, nor is there a single “boss monster” that signals the end. The next chapter has its own set of events to get it going once the PCs reach 6th level. The events of \"Rivers Run Red\" can continue to play out once that chapter’s events begin.</p>"

After the PCs’ kingdom has had a chance to start to grow—preferably once they’ve expanded a settlement into a town and their kingdom has reached 4th level—their new nation catches the attention of their neighbors to the west: @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF]. And while visitors from this kingdom may be commonplace, one early arrival is anything but a common visitor.</p><figure class=\"right\"><img class=\"flip\" src=\"modules\\pf2e-kingmaker\\assets\\actor-portraits\\kingmaker\\grigori.webp\" width=\"300\" /><figcaption>@UUID[Actor.Bq2eST0Ke4MnKXgR]</figcaption></figure><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.oIa3VpYVBvzqZ2r2] is a charismatic orator and an agent of Pitax who seeks to undermine the PCs’ authority while spying on their kingdom. He shows up in the kingdom’s capital while the PCs are out adventuring and immediately begins giving speeches criticizing and denigrating their leadership. More and more of the townsfolk gather to hear him talk and, as the days wear on, he builds a wellspring of support among the disaffected settlers in the town. Every decision the PCs make has a winner and a loser, and Grigori is gifted at shifting focus to the losers in these decisions and riling them up. Whether it is appealing to the citizens who didn’t get what they wanted when the PCs build a new city block, to spinning a narrative that paints a recent event in the most horrid light for those for whom the outcome was a negative, a properly played Grigori should become a constant barb in the players’ side and one of the most memorable villains they encounter. Grigori takes great pains to avoid breaking any of the PCs’ laws so that they have no justification to arrest him other than that they want to silence him.</p><p>Grigori isn’t fully aware of how King Irovetti is using him. In order to cover his tracks and retain plausible deniability, Irovetti used layers of agents to hire Grigori; as far as he knows, Grigori was hired to cause trouble in this fledgling town by agents from Fort Drelev to the west, not by the ruler of Pitax itself.</p><p>If the PCs have built an inn, that’s where Grigori’s been staying; otherwise, he’s arranged to stay in a shed or unused house in one of the capital city’s housing lots. By the time the PCs first learn of the bard, his orations have increased the kingdom’s Unrest by 1. Ignoring the rabble-rouser and hoping he’ll go away is the worst way to handle this problem; if the PCs allow Grigori to continue to do his thing, see @UUID[.y8Zct3DVguv8EjKF] for the ramifications.</p><p>The first time the PCs have a chance to see Grigori in action, he is giving a talk in the town commons, speaking of the PCs’ “gross negligence” in abandoning the town to “go gallivanting through the Narlmarches on fool’s errands” and leaving the town exposed to banditry, monster attacks, and worse. He takes care to bring up recent dangerous events in particular, be they random events the PCs’ kingdom endured or Kundal’s attacks on the citizens. He further suggests that the PCs may be responsible because their wilderness explorations drive monsters into more civilized areas. He claims that the PCs have acquired much wealth during their adventures, and have used it only to enrich themselves, not to aid the town or its citizens; he lists any recent (or not-so-recent) acquisitions the PCs have made (whether purchased, gifted, or found) as examples.</p><p>Several townspeople have gathered to hear Grigori talk, and shouts of agreement and mutters of discontent increase as the speech progresses, helped along by Grigori’s subtle use of magic. Without intervention, the discontent only grows over time. If the PCs intervene, Grigori attempts to eloquently refute any points they try to make while trying to goad them into violence. His goal is to provoke them into attacking him.</p><h3>Using Force Against Grigori</h3><p>If the PCs try to remove Grigori forcefully, he accuses them of oppression and of trying to “thwart the voice of the people.” Should the PCs attack him, Grigori does nothing to defend himself, at least for this first skirmish, and such actions only cause more people to turn from the PCs and heed Grigori’s words. Use the crowd of the kingdom’s citizens as a shield for Grigori, with those unarmed citizens trying to stop the PCs from arresting the bard. If it becomes apparent that the PCs will be successful in arresting him or restraining him, Grigori attempts to flee into the city (using an @UUID[Actor.Bq2eST0Ke4MnKXgR.Item.OyGmWsFPVajZVWtE] as soon as possible to aid in his escape), but if cornered he does his best to fight back. Only if he’s brought below 30 HP does he give up the fight and surrender.</p><h3>Diplomatic Negotiations</h3><p>If the PCs approach him in private, Grigori’s attitude is hostile (although he won’t initiate combat). He would rather have his confrontation with the PCs in a public venue, but if the PCs prevent it, he uses Deception to convince them he’ll tone down his rabble-rousing antics, only to start back up a few days later. Under no circumstances will Grigori divulge anything beyond the fact that he is working for “parties interested in seeing your little nation fail,” and that he aims to remove the PCs from their positions of authority over the town; even those admissions are made only under duress. Any successful attempts at Diplomacy or Intimidation quiet him for 1 day, but he returns to the town commons the next day to continue his tirades, with new tales of his “repression” at the hands of the PCs. Should the PCs later attack him, Grigori defends himself and does his best to make the fight as public as possible, hoping the townsfolk see him as the victim and the PCs as overbearing thugs.</p>"

Both kobolds are fearful for their lives, be they in the PCs’ hands or in Hargulka’s hands. They were pressed into service by Hargulka after the troll attacked their band, the Treeshouters (once located several miles south of area @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.JA4V2iDJug2ZAaRo]). Presented with the option to serve the troll in a way that afforded them their lives, Prazil and Kereek readily agreed. Hargulka sees the two as a combination of pet and trophy, and while the kobolds hate and fear Hargulka equally, they do their best to serve him to protect their surviving kin.</p><p>Black-scaled Prazil—very excitable and a little dimwitted—views Kereek as his best friend. Clad in makeshift armor consisting mostly of a breastplate and a scale loincloth, Prazil is a cheerful optimist who’s happy to meet others and typically sees the best in people. Incredibly loyal to his friends, if combat breaks out, he fights to the death to protect Kereek.</p><p>Red-scaled Kereek, on the other hand, is all cunning and pragmatism. He’s willing to do whatever he must to get the job done, though his giant ego blinds him to his own shortcomings. He lords over Prazil, though in his heart he cares for his protector more than he realizes. He’s willing to abandon Prazil if he must, but he will plot vengeance against an enemy who forces him to do so.</p><p>The kobolds eagerly agree to guide the PCs to Hargulka’s lair if asked, hoping to earn their lives (if not their freedom) by being helpful to the PCs. They can even provide a crude map of some of the chambers within his lair.</p><p>If, on the other hand, Kereek and Prazil manage to avoid being caught for a week, the PCs can encounter them again in area @UUID[.fOFZQoO1xCuTV1QQ] once they begin exploring Hargulka’s domain.</p><section class=\"milestone\"><p><strong>Rewards</strong>: If the PCs manage to catch the kobolds or prevent them from spending a full week spying and vandalizing, grant them 30 Kingdom XP and regular character XP as if they had defeated the pair in combat.

Wedged between the River Kingdoms and Brevoy, the approximately 35,000-square-mile swath of wilderness has long been referred to as “stolen”—though “from whom” and “by whom” vary depending on the point of view. In Brevoy, the lands are considered stolen from that nation’s southern expanse by bandits and barbarians from Numeria, Iobaria, or the River Kingdoms. In the River Kingdoms, the general impression is that Brevoy deliberately allowed the lands to fall into the hands of monsters (and worse) in order to prevent the lords of the River Kingdoms from taking them over. Even within the wildlands themselves, lands are stolen and conquered in struggles between groups of centaurs, kobolds, fey, trolls, bandits, lizardfolk, boggards, barbarians, and more, all constantly skirmishing to expand their holdings while defending their lands from enemies.</p><p>In truth, the Stolen Lands belong to no one and are stolen from no one. Many have tried to claim them, but the abandoned ruins that dot the swath of wilderness stand as testaments to the difficulty of such a task. They have remained wild with fierce tenacity, a haven for monsters, criminals, and dangerous secrets, and as such, have posed a menace to their neighboring nations for as long as anyone can remember. Unknown to many who look upon these lands from surrounding nations and empires, a hidden hierarchy of latent power resides within the Stolen Lands, organized under the watchful eyes of @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.vtrUtpKwKZVyLdLD], a cursed nymph queen from the mysterious realm of the First World. Yet these times of relative calm in the Stolen Lands are coming to an end.</p><p>Under Lady @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.kv4bSiz3OfUFDXnM]’s stewardship, the swordlords of Restov are poised to send agents and explorers into the disputed region. Spurred to action in part by an increase in aggression among the bandits and the worsening political tensions to the north, the swordlords hope their agents can chart and settle the Stolen Lands. The establishment of four new “puppet kingdoms,” all beholden to Restov’s swordlords and the rest of Rostland, would bring not only freedom from banditry and raids along Rostland’s southern border, but also the resources and clout needed to make a play for a higher station in Brevoy’s complicated political scene. If all goes well, the return of the Stolen Lands to Brevic control could give Rostland the footing it needs to challenge the Surtova hold for the crown.</p><p>Unfortunately, the swordlords haven’t anticipated the result of these pushes into the Stolen Lands, for in each of these regions, agents and allies of @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.vtrUtpKwKZVyLdLD], King @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.UG1YQsZGkWshc4AY] of Pitax, the Tiger Lord barbarians, and others are already laying their own plans. When confronted by explorers and expansionists from the north, their reactions will be anything but calm and serene.

Encounter-specific activities beyond those detailed in the Gamemastery Guide are presented in the context of the encounter text itself.</p></aside><p>The @UUID[Scene.AJ1k5II28u72JOmz] is divided into 20 zones, 19 of which are keyed to different levels. (The Brevoy zone is not keyed to a level since the PCs cannot settle it or expand into it during the scope of this Adventure Path; it’s therefore listed as “zone 0.”) Zone levels suggest the level the PCs are likely to be as the storyline moves into that zone and indicate the general threats that might confront explorers in that zone.</p><p>Each zone contains within it a number of encounter sites, all of which are tagged using a two-letter code for the zone plus a number for the encounter itself. These \"encounters\" can be found in the following journal entries: @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi], @UUID[JournalEntry.lMIawppop9uCHRXq], @UUID[JournalEntry.GRbTr3VTyhezOEhW], @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF].</p><p>In addition, the Stolen Lands include several larger encounter sites and dungeons. Those that play specific roles in the primary storyline of Kingmaker- locations like the @UUID[JournalEntry.AgbaF8i9XDLEtxqe.JournalEntryPage.mnlD2PF09v5WWQrn], @UUID[JournalEntry.OcO78IbhsDP8cUof.JournalEntryPage.RzHbxYswWo3145mp], and @UUID[JournalEntry.yGGSDRma9yTWwdeo.JournalEntryPage.jXuSbtaOAWEuRXtr]- are detailed in the appropriate journals for their respective chapters. Others- like @UUID[.4gc0KFhsfVTXQGTs] and @UUID[.W2JjcQj6vysfR53G]- are areas that the players might stumble across as they explore, and are detailed within this journal entry in the parts that follow.</p><p>A summary of each zone is provided in the @UUID[.LCdukChAYoW5bXvO] table, which links to the journals containing an expanded description, wandering monster table, and encounters for each one.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>Scene</p><p>@UUID[Scene.AJ1k5II28u72JOmz]</p></header><p>This module includes a highly detailed representation of the Stolen Lands region map.

Remaking the map allows us to design specifically for it to be used on FoundryVTT, and we've enhanced the scene with several features that improve the experience of running the adventure on a virtual tabletop.

You can mount the four posters onto foam-core boards and use them as a physical representation of the party’s progress and as a tool to track their growing kingdom. Stickers can be used to indicate landmarks, forts, villages, cities, roads, dungeons, and even empty hexes that have been thoroughly explored. The posters give your players an idea of what areas are left to explore and which parts of the PCs’ kingdom may need further development.</p><p>A much smaller version of the map of the Stolen Lands appears on the face of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0l?Pathfinder-Kingmaker-Kingdom-Management-Screen\" title=\"Kingmaker Kingdom Management Screen\">Kingmaker Kingdom Management Screen</a>; you can use wet-erase markers on it to provide a similar effect.

(False.)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Some of the bandits wear amulets that resemble a stag’s skull. These bandits belong to a debased cult dedicated to a hideous animal demon. (The second sentence is false.)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>There used to be a bridge crossing the Shrike River to the southeast, but bandits ruined it. They say the old bridge keeper Davik Nettles haunts the place now.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The bandits are getting braver and more organized, and there are whispers they’ve got a new leader: a man who dresses in animals’ bones and calls himself the Stag Lord.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Bandits aren’t the only things in the Kamelands that cause trouble—kobolds and gremlins live in the hills too. They aren’t as much trouble as the bandits, but their presence certainly makes the idea of settling the land less attractive.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>The primary trade route between the River Kingdoms and Brevoy is the East Sellen River, a major waterway that runs through a swampy region to the west called the Hooktongue Slough. That trade route has been closed for several months, due to increasing violence from members of the boggard knots who dwell there. Hopefully, the frog folk keep to the swamp and don’t turn their bulging eyes east toward the Narlmarches!</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>A group of evil monks and priests of the goddess of hatred, extortion, and spite once lived on the northern shore of the Tuskwater. I bet there are still cultists out there, and that they’re behind the sudden rise in bandit raids! (Partially false: a monastery dedicated to Gyronna did once sit on the shores of the Tuskwater, and while the bandits have repurposed the ruined structure as their hideout, Gyronna’s faith has nothing to do with the Stag Lord or his bandits.)</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Some people report that a unicorn lives in the Narlmarches, but sightings of the magnificent creature have fallen off in recent months. Perhaps the unicorn was driven out by the bandits?</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Folks have mentioned spotting strange plantlife and fungi growing in the wilds—flora that doesn’t seem natural to the Stolen Lands. (This rumor doesn’t pertain to any one encounter in particular, but is meant to foreshadow the growing influence of the First World over the region as the Adventure Path progresses.)</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>An old friend of a friend had a brother—a traveling wizard—who went missing in the Stolen Lands a while back. His spellbook is probably just rotting away in the underbrush or in some monster’s lair. Shame, really!</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>The Stag Lord has risen from the dead and now stalks the Greenbelt, gathering an army of ghostly bandits from an ancient crypt in the eastern Kamelands. (This rumor is false, but can’t occur at all until after the PCs kill the Stag Lord at the end of Chapter 3.)</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Beware the hateful hermit to the south. He speaks to beasts and lives in a hollow tree.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>A red dragon lives in the Narlmarches and eats anyone who crosses its path. (False. This rumor is the result of sightings of the drake at area SP1.)</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Some gnome explorers came by a few weeks ago, claiming they’re here to map the entire Greenbelt; they were last seen heading up the Skunk River.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>A hag known as the Swamp Witch lives in a marsh on the northwest shore of the Tuskwater. She consorts with demons and steals children, boiling them for stew in her magic cauldron. (False.)</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>A brutish hill giant has been seen wandering the southern Kamelands. Give him a wide berth—or a stiff drink—and he’ll leave you alone. For the most part.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>To the west, there’s an old ruin built long ago by the elves. Some say it’s full of treasure, but others say it’s haunted by angry spirits and worse.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>In the southern Stolen Lands dwells a band of violent lizardfolk led by a lizard king who talks to the spirits of his dead ancestors.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>The old tower on the island in Candlemere marks a place where the boundary between this world and another has grown thin; it’s now guarded by some sort of deadly monster.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>The Swamp Witch is friendly enough if you call out to her before you enter her yard.

The PCs automatically discover it when they @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Z8aa6afUterlfh5i] in the hex. At your discretion, particularly enormous or obvious landmarks can be spotted from even further distances.</p><p><strong>Resource Encounter</strong>: A resource encounter contains materials of value to the PCs’ kingdom or opportunities for its expansion. If the PCs explore hexes containing resource encounters before they begin building their kingdom, bring these potential resources to their attention once they begin focusing on kingdom management (full rules for kingdoms appear @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7]).</p><p><strong>Standard Encounter</strong>: A standard encounter is automatically discovered when the PCs @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QIrJJ1pl4H6DctaQ] the hex. If the hex is open terrain, it’s also automatically discovered when the PCs @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Z8aa6afUterlfh5i] in the hex.</p><p><strong>Secret Encounter</strong>: If the party doesn’t already know about the site’s location, such as by learning about it from an NPC, the PCs discover a secret encounter only if they take specific actions (often involving a successful skill check) as detailed in the encounter’s text.</p><h3>Fair Warning!</h3><p>While the chance of stumbling upon an encounter well beyond the PCs’ capabilities is part of the attraction and thrill of sandbox play, it can also catch players off guard. The flow of Kingmaker’s storyline seeks to keep the players focused on zones that are appropriate for their level, but still, the players should be free to make choices of their own.</p><p>As long as the PCs are exploring hexes in zones that are keyed no more than 1 level higher than the party, there’s no need to warn the players. In hexes 2 or 3 levels above the party, you’re probably safe letting the PCs find out what awaits them organically, but be prepared to help out the PCs if they get in trouble. If the PCs attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Z8aa6afUterlfh5i] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QIrJJ1pl4H6DctaQ] a hex that’s 4 or more levels higher, though, consider providing some form of warning that they may be getting in over their head. An old “Danger” sign, the discovery of a dead monster that would have been a difficult challenge for them, or the sighting of a distant overwhelming threat like a giant, dragon, or megafauna can let the players know to proceed with caution. Advice and rumors from NPCs can help as well, but make sure that the players don’t interpret a sincere warning as a tempting dare!</p><h2>Random Encounters and Hazards</h2><section class=\"fvtt\"><p>This module includes a rollable table for each zone which allows you to quickly resolve random encounters. The tables are linked within the journals for each zone, or you can find them by navigating to the Rollable Tables section of the sidebar and look for the folder \"Encounters\".</p></section><p>As the PCs explore the Stolen Lands, you can liven things up using random encounters with monsters that roam the area. You can leave these random encounters to a roll of the die by making a flat check, or you can simply decide that a random encounter happens whenever you feel like the pace of play could use a bit of action. With the exception of the first zone, each zone has its own random encounter table (presented at the start of each zone’s section), or you can pick a thematic monster of your choice.</p><p>You can also spice up exploration with environmental hazards. Hazards like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.hazards.Actor.A93flWUsot3FmC7t] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.hazards.Actor.C6nFe8SCWJ8FmLOT] (both detailed in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>) or others like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.hazards.Actor.vTdWEBzJzltMM6r4], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.hazards.Actor.gFt2nzQrVgXM9tmJ], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.hazards.Actor.lgyGhpyPosriQUzE] (all detailed in the <em>Gamemastery Guide</em>) can help spice up stretches of exploration when a more complex combat encounter isn’t needed.

Camping encounters can help to make the Stolen Lands seem even more dangerous and can give PCs opportunities to earn a bit more XP if they’ve fallen behind. At the same time, if the PCs spend time camping in lands they’ve claimed, consider the option of downplaying the dangers they face to make it feel like the PCs are making progress in settling the dangerous territory.

If you roll lower, the temperature is lower, the sky is clearer, and the wind is calmer. If you roll higher, the temperature is higher, there is more precipitation, and the wind is stronger.

The 100-foot-tall tree stands as a known landmark and is visible for miles around. It’s also infested with mitflits. These malicious gremlins spend their days perfecting sadistic pranks, torturing animals, playing with oversized vermin, and tormenting the @UUID[.cV7XJ6rzlU63zkib] who dwell in a cave 12 miles to the south.</p><p>Recently, the mitflits stole the Sootscales’ most holy statue and are holding it hostage for the third time in as many months. Though the mitflits thoroughly enjoy this little game, the kobolds have new leadership, and with @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.6lfxAptNHvLXYktt] now making the decisions for the Sootscales, their retaliation was swift and, to the gremlins, unexpectedly insulting. That the kobolds dared to try to reclaim the treasure the mitflits themselves had just stolen—and before the gremlins even got the chance to gloat—has truly outraged the little blue creatures. For many days now, the lands between the Old Sycamore and the Sootscale caves have become the site of a sort of miniaturized war, and as the PCs approach the Old Sycamore, they’ll find it increasingly common to stumble across dead kobolds and mitflits, their pitiful gear stripped by the victors.</p><h2>The Mitflit Lair</h2><p>The mitflit lair itself has only a single entrance, hidden amid the ancient sycamore’s roots. A PC who succeeds at a @Check[type:perception|dc:15|traits:action:search] check finds this hidden entrance, which consists of a root-lined shaft that drops 10 feet down to the middle of a 40-foot tunnel; this tunnel runs east-west and connects areas @UUID[.Qnb8IMMCn6kyMbjA] and @UUID[.BJdGqLaV6MVpPCyY]. These roots allow a person to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy] down into either area by succeeding at a @Check[type:athletics|dc:15|traits:action:climb] check.</p><p>If the PCs observe the sycamore from afar, every night they spot five or six mitflits from area @UUID[.cz2TE6PiLEQtdmfg] scampering out of the hole to scatter into the surrounding hills, off to gather food, catch animals to torment, or look for Sootscales to fight.</p><p>The mitflits are Small, and their lair is accordingly sized. Ceiling height is rarely over 5 feet, and much of the uppermost foot is a tangle of roots and dangling fungus, forcing Medium creatures to stoop and awkwardly adjust the swing of their weapons—as a result, these creatures take a –1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and are clumsy 1 within the lair.</p><p>The mitflit hive beneath the Old Sycamore once housed several dozen of the gremlins, but the war with the Sootscales has thinned their ranks. Currently, the hive numbers 31 mitflits, although when the PCs arrive, only 19 (plus their leader) lurk within. If the PCs fail to drive the mitflits out by killing them all, the remaining mitflits return to the hive at the end of the day, replenishing their population at the rate of 6 mitflits per hour over the two hours following dusk. At the end of the last hour, a final mitflit straggler pops his little blue head in, for better or worse.</p><h3>The Perils of Befriending Gremlins</h3><p>Unlike their mortal enemies, the Sootscales, the mitflits of the Old Sycamore aren’t particularly well-suited for integration into the PCs’ kingdom—yet they still remain sapient creatures. Unlike kobolds, though, mitflits are not humanoids—these creatures are fey, and as a result, their nature as gremlins is as much the result of supernatural factors as it is their society.</p><p>If the PCs manage to establish a peaceful accord with the mitflits, they’ll need to work hard to watch over them and to help them avoid their impulses to wreck things and undo hard work. They are, after all, still gremlins, and the urge to meddle is difficult for mitflits to unlearn. Exactly how difficult befriending the mitflits can be is left to you to determine, but if the PCs do manage the accomplishment, consider giving them some sort of benefit as well. After all, the mitflits are fey creatures, and even though they’re natives of the Material Plane, they may be able to provide some insight into the First World blooms once they begin.</p>"

Recently, a purple kobold has become an important leader among the Sootscales. Calling himself Tartuk, this mysterious kobold allowed the previous leader to retain a largely ceremonial role as the leader of the tribe, but @UUID[Actor.RL6cxasbeQMtCDvV] is no fool.

They have occupied the mine for decades, periodically clashing with the region’s bandits, mitflits, and trappers, but always enduring. The Sootscales all have black scales and share a fondness for swimming in the Shrike River and catching fish with their tiny teeth.</p><p>The individual kobolds still consider Chief Sootscale to be their leader, even though the chief himself is cowed by the eerie magic and creepy coloration presented by Tartuk. The weird purple kobold claims to hail from somewhere to the west (the closest thing to the truth he’s told the kobolds), and he’s a destructive force who derives a perverse glee from manipulating the tribe.</p><p>As the lair itself was originally a human mine, the caves themselves aren’t completely awkward for Medium creatures—the kobolds themselves adore their eight-foot-high “vaulted ceilings,” and consider them a sign of great kobold prosperity.</p><h3>Recruiting the Sootscales</h3><p>If the PCs manage to rescue the Sootscales from Tartuk’s influence, the kobolds are confused and frightened for a short time. If Chief Sootscale himself still lives, he’ll thank the PCs personally and tell them that the Sootscales owe them; if he perished, a warrior named Gekel steps up to take his name and place. They allow the PCs to take all the treasures Tartuk claimed for himself, but they also promise to pay the PCs back at some point in the future as best they can.</p><p>Once the PCs establish their kingdom, the Sootscales’ gratitude makes them particularly receptive to the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.nc4XV5NFuHDz93O0] kingdom activity, and if the PCs use this activity, the actual result is improved by one degree of success.</p><p>If the Sootscales become integrated into the PCs’ kingdom, the industrious kobolds’ lair functions as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.8B6PmgtMH2TthBSX], granting the PCs’ kingdom 2 Ore commodities each turn.

The boggards of M’botuu threaten trade routes and have made the region from the southern River Kingdoms to Brevoy too dangerous for river trade. Although the exiled boggard Garuum might request that the PCs seek revenge for him against his old knot (see the @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.6JPqGqeYHNastNOd] quest), or the PCs might seek out members of the knot after hearing rumors about them, no one during this adventure specifically tasks the PCs with defeating the M’botuu boggards to reopen the East Sellen trade route.</p><p>The word “M’botuu” loosely translates as “Those Who Swim in Blood.” M’botuu legend claims their knot sprang wholly from the marsh itself when @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.RUzMtIQal0drPwQY], their vile demon goddess, flooded this part of the River Kingdoms by vomiting up a swamp. The boggards then multiplied over the years, waging war against the hated water-walking bog striders, slaughtering human settlers, and eventually dominating the entire region.</p><p>With the arrival of Drelev’s settlers from Brevoy, however, times have drastically changed for M’botuu. @UUID[Actor.sedubjznhIbVfCkD], the M’botuu priest-king, has grown increasingly agitated by the number of interlopers in the region and has been attempting to gather the various boggard families from the outlying region under his banner to form an army, but all that’s resulted from this attempt has been a massive civil war as the boggards bickered over who should actually lead the army. Now, having seen their once-feared leader’s commands so blatantly mocked and ignored by the other boggards of the Slough, Sepoko’s followers question his leadership. As a result, Sepoko has been making secret visits to the spirit naga of the @UUID[JournalEntry.GRbTr3VTyhezOEhW.JournalEntryPage.5mmKhhH0wt7aDMFY] in the hope that her magic can turn the tide against those who shamed him on the battlefield. Instead, he’s only managed to get himself inveigled by the naga, who has been using him to send boggards west to the Scar for her to eat. Rather than sending his own boggards, though, Sepoko has increased the raids on nearby knots, much to the delight of his followers, who see this as proof that their leader has not lost his ferocious side.</p><aside class=\"right\"><h3>Muddy Caverns</h3><p>Areas H6–H13 of M’botuu consist of a network of caves. Although sized for Medium creatures, these caves are hardly comfortable. Thick mats of roots hang from the ceiling, and the floors are thick morasses of mud, water, and fungus. All of these areas are considered difficult terrain as a result, but boggards, due to their swamp stride ability, can move through these areas with ease.</p><p>Additionally, several of these caves can be accessed via holes in the ceiling that open into low mounds above. Each of these holes (indicated on the @UUID[Scene.o4TnfuUopIaJ8AWP] map as lighter patches) includes a number of knotted roots; a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:10] check is required to ascend or descend from the caves via these routes, and it’s a 10-foot drop to the muddy floor. The PCs can find these “door flaps” automatically if they are standing in the spot where they egress up on top.</p></aside><h3>The Boggard Village</h3><p>The village of M’botuu is located in Hooktongue Slough at area @UUID[JournalEntry.GRbTr3VTyhezOEhW.JournalEntryPage.F2jziCo01RR37QUd].</p><p>A total of 51 boggards dwell in M’botuu; the majority lurk in the wet muddy caves below the village itself. Seven of the boggards are Sepoko’s most faithful wardens and remain completely loyal to him; the others are currently somewhat unsure of their leader. If Sepoko and all his wardens are killed, the remaining boggards of M’botuu slink off into the swamp and no longer directly oppose river traffic.</p><p>Many of the boggards lurking in M’botuu are hardly challenges for the level the PCs will need to be to fight Sepoko and his wardens. This gives the PCs a chance to feel powerful by fighting lots of foes at once without much danger, and it lets them feel tough when swarms of boggards run for cover. But extended fights against lots of lower-level opponents can quickly get old for a group of mid-level PCs; as soon as you feel that this is the case, have any other boggards cower and flee, only playing out battles against the boggard wardens and their priest-king. Sepoko may even gather his guards to his side and seek the PCs out once he learns they’re invading his village, taking the fight to them rather than waiting for them to come to him. In any event, 10th-level PCs shouldn’t be earning any experience for defeating low-level boggards!</p><h2>M'botuu and the Kingdom</h2><p>As detailed in the Resource block in @UUID[JournalEntry.GRbTr3VTyhezOEhW.JournalEntryPage.F2jziCo01RR37QUd], the PCs can potentially bring M’botuu into their kingdom, but the boggards who dwell here remain evil. At the start of every Kingdom turn in which the boggards remain a part of the kingdom, the PCs must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]; failure indicates their influence increases the kingdom’s Corruption or Crime by 1 (players’ choice). This continues until the PCs can achieve a critical success with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.FGQfcX6BelYrJatp] to the village to convince them to either minimize their cruelties or adopt a less disruptive lifestyle. Of course, if all of the boggards are slain and the PCs simply use the site that remains, these problems can be avoided entirely.</p>"

She feels little responsibility to these other fey, who in turn think of her almost as a force of nature and, when they must speak of her, simply call her the @UUID[.nv9PtmO4iCuCwToV]. The evil fey prey upon the infrequent travelers in the southern Narlmarches; enough hunters and trappers have gone missing near the ruined keep that most give it a wide berth these days.</p><h2>Restoring the Keep</h2><p>As mentioned in the Resource section of @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.HD0KAGBGF1eUoAw8], once the PCs defeat the creatures dwelling in the Forgotten Keep, they can use it as the basis for a new castle if they choose to build a settlement here. If they do so, consider having some lingering mysteries continue to vex the PCs, almost as if some long-term curse or fell influence over the keep continues to plague the site. One potential plot could involve the eventual manifestation of the @UUID[Actor.LdIVntI4ho9eKTVt]’s ghost. Since transforming the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.Actor.SfPoGbcaQqPlgJ85] into a ghost increases its level by 2, you shouldn’t begin this plot development until the PCs are 7th or 8th level, at which point facing an undead version of this already frightening foe can bring them back to the Forgotten Keep for one more adventure!</p><p>Bringing the Forgotten Keep into the kingdom can also attract other attention from the south. In time, historians from the elven nation of Kyonin could pay the PCs a visit with a request to explore, examine, and possibly even restore the Forgotten Keep to its original glory. Treat this development as a @UUID[JournalEntry.dAtoyQhSfSBvjr2W.JournalEntryPage.bXc4KHMVR2NYrUt2] kingdom event that occurs during the Event Phase of a Kingdom turn that plays out a few months after the PCs claim the Forgotten Keep. If this kingdom event resolves with a success or a critical success, elven diplomats seek to establish a permanent presence in the area, and a @UUID[JournalEntry.dAtoyQhSfSBvjr2W.JournalEntryPage.EJXLlpCCnfHLxNHN] kingdom event automatically triggers at the end of the next Kingdom turn. If, on the other hand, the Diplomatic Overture resulted in a critical failure, the end of the next kingdom turn brings an automatic @UUID[JournalEntry.dAtoyQhSfSBvjr2W.JournalEntryPage.OURUA8YrKosurVYG], with certain citizens accusing the PCs of appropriating the elven ruins for their own shady agendas.</p>"

In these cases, Chief Sootscale backs down and agrees to talk, his kobold minions ready to resume the fight at his word. The chief begs for mercy if reduced to 6 Hit Points or less, and if he’s killed, the remaining kobolds drop their weapons and surrender as well.</p></section><p>If the PCs can speak to the kobolds, there are two possibilities. If they have not already recovered the statue of Old Sharptooth from the mitflit lair, Chief Sootscale realizes that sending the PCs to retrieve the statuette might be his tribe’s best hope. He glumly admits that if the statue of Old Sharptooth isn’t returned soon, Sharptooth’s curse will cause all the kobolds to turn yellow and die.</p><p>If the player characters already have the statue, Chief Sootscale demands they hand it over to him. If they do, he holds the statue in his hands with a fierce look of concentration, as if he were making a particularly difficult decision. After a tense moment, he shrieks in triumph, raises the statue over his head, and then smashes it down onto the ground, shattering it. The other kobolds in the room freeze in absolute shock while the chief, a frantic grin on his snout, thanks the PCs for “freeing us from this curse” and then encourages them to come with him to “kill the usurper.”</p><p>Although there is, in fact, no real curse, Chief Sootscale believes that by breaking the statue, he has freed himself from its reach. Emboldened and infused with a rush of self-confidence for the first time since Tartuk put the notion of a “curse” into the tribe’s minds, the chief leads his kobolds—and the PCs—in a coup against Tartuk in area @UUID[.JbEPYOjiZ5DsoKnl].</p>"

No Sootscale has even remotely considered the possibility that he’s not really a kobold at all.</p><p>Tartuk first came to the Sootscales not long after the PCs completed @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR.JournalEntryPage.uSClnplhnYBedYur], so the amount of time he has been in charge of the Sootscales depends on how long it took the PCs to get here. Regardless of the time spent, Tartuk has firmly entrenched himself in the role of the Sootscales’ spiritual leader, in part by capitalizing on their fear of Old Sharptooth, but also by frightening them with displays of his illusory magic. Early on, kobolds that questioned his right to rule were called out as “bad kobolds” who were sacrificed to prevent the curse of Old Sharptooth from descending upon them all. He’s never appeared before the kobolds in his true form or mentioned his real name in front of them, and by now, the Sootscales have entirely accepted him as one of them, despite his strange purple coloration.</p><p>Earlier in the month, after the mitflits of the @UUID[.SwaUdwDDanpOOn5Q] broke into the Sootscale caverns and stole the statue of Old Sharptooth, Tartuk almost lost control of the tribe, but he has managed to take advantage of the growing war between the two groups, convincing the kobolds to view it as a test from Old Sharptooth. The Sootscales have managed to win back their statue twice before, but each time, the gremlins stole it again before the statuette could be returned to its proper place.</p><p>Of course, the whole gremlin conflict has disrupted Tartuk’s actual plans for the region, and his patience is wearing thin. If the PCs arrive at the cave, Tartuk is startled but, counting on the fact that they won’t recognize him in his disguise, he encourages them to retrieve the statuette of Old Sharptooth for the Sootscales—and to kill all the mitflits in the process. If the PCs return triumphantly, Tartuk decides to accelerate his plan to remove them from the competition for the Stolen Lands and orders the kobolds to slay the PCs as a final glorious offering to Old Sharptooth—a command the kobolds fanatically try to carry out.</p><p>On the other hand, if the PCs have already recovered the statuette or have recruited Chief Sootscale’s aid, Tartuk is shocked. He tries to reassert his control over the tribe, only to fail, and is forced to fight for his life with only his two most fanatically devoted minions to aid him. If reduced to fewer than 10 Hit Points, Tartuk does what he can to escape—if he manages to do so, he can become a continuing thorn in the PCs’ sides as you see fit. If, on the other hand, Tartuk is slain, his body reverts to that of his true form as Tartuccio and any remaining kobolds are so horrified by the development that they flee the region unless the PCs had already formed an alliance with Chief Sootscale, in which case the kobolds are graciously thankful for their aid.</p></section><section class=\"treasure\"><article><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.x5mOSTgMkYwAKQYa]:</strong> Tartuk demanded the kobolds pile all their treasure (plus any new treasures they gained from their war against the mitflits) in a heap in the eastern alcove of his den. This mound consists of a huge amount of worthless shiny objects, such as quartz and mica crystals, bits of metal, broken weapons and armor, and other garbage. In addition, the pile contains 320 cp, 42 sp, 12 gp, two <em>sleep arrows</em>, a <em>+1 weapon potency</em> runestone, and a soiled leather bag. Inside the bag are the treasures stolen from the mitflits (who in turn stole them from the Thorn River bandits, who took them from Oleg’s Trading Post). The leather bag contains 21 sp, 9 gp, 1 pp, one dose of <em>dust of appearance</em>, and a plain brass wedding ring set with a single pearl—this is @UUID[JournalEntry.OnxXPMl0iaK9lUp1.JournalEntryPage.xdtZweRFm0v3dfco], worth 12 gp as an item of jewelry but far more to Oleg and Svetlana.</p><p>Tartuk’s personal journal, written in Undercommon, sits on a table here as well. Within its pages, the bitter gnome records much of his history, giving the characters a chance to gain some insight into his mindset and background; he mentions several times that he hopes to achieve success in gaining a hold in the Stolen Land so that he can impress his “patron,” but nowhere in the text does he reveal this patron is Pitax. The final dozen pages of the journal contain information on his plans to infiltrate the Sootscales and use them as a force to control the region.</p></article></section>"

Nonetheless, Kingmaker’s overarching plot doesn’t truly begin until they make that first fateful trip to the trading post.</p><p>Oleg’s Trading Post is a repurposed border fort located at the southern edge of Rostland (and thus Brevoy—area @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.4OzzzKtfhPKmGFR5] on the map of the Stolen Lands). To the south, the green line of the Narlmarches looms only a few miles away. Owned and operated by a stern and somewhat unimaginative man named @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.wF0M7MjVsD1F2v0E], the trading post’s remote location and inconvenient distance from a major river prevents it from realizing significant financial success. This situation suits the Levetons fine, as they chose the remote location out of a desire to escape the constant machinations and political maneuverings they saw dominating urban life in Restov. All they ever really wanted from the trading post was a place to live far enough from the sins of civilization without being so distant that they couldn’t enjoy most of its benefits. Accepting a charter from Restov to rebuild an abandoned fort into a trading post seemed like the perfect solution.</p><p>Oleg and Svetlana have spent the past several months renovating the old fort. Their customers are few and far between, consisting mostly of trappers, hunters, and an eccentric local hermit named @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.NSCPFMAAUkbqCpsv]. Until recently, trading in furs, jerky, and the occasional magic potion from Bokken has provided the couple enough coin to keep them in business. Unfortunately, the new trading post has caught the attention of the Stag Lord’s bandits, who have been shaking him down on a regular basis.</p><h3>The Levetons</h3><p>Oleg is a man with a no-nonsense attitude and fierce pride. Were it not for the fact that he fears for his wife’s safety, he would have doubtless sacrificed his life to the bandits in a foolish attempt to defend his stock when they first paid a visit three months ago. Being forced each month to hand over his inventory to the bandits shames him, but he masks his shame with gruffness and stubborn determination. His wife Svetlana knows she’s the reason he hasn’t stood up to the bandits, and she also knows how much the situation pains him: that act of humility is crushing his soul. She’s pleaded with him several times to abandon the post and return to Restov, but Oleg has stubbornly refused defeat. His sole concession to Svetlana’s wishes has been to send requests to the city for reinforcements whenever a trapper or hunter stops by on their way back to civilization. He recently received word back that a group of guards is coming to aid him, but no sign of such protection has yet arrived, and the bandits are due to make their monthly visit to the trading post. The PCs’ arrival gives Oleg his first real chance to stand up to the bandits.</p><p>Additional information on Oleg and Svetlana, as well as information on how the trading post changes over the course of this Adventure Path, can be found in their @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.wF0M7MjVsD1F2v0E].</p>"

                            "text": "<p>Oleg and Svetlana are expecting visitors. A traveling hunter on his way back from Restov recently delivered the message that the Levetons’ request for defensive aid against the bandits is just about approved, but it will still be a few days before a patrol can be sent. The message went on to inform the Levetons that a group of adventurers chartered to explore the Greenbelt would be along sooner, though, and they could well be of use in defending the post against the bandits. Oleg and Svetlana take this news in different ways.</p><p>When the PCs arrive, Svetlana greets them warmly, presenting them with hearty stew and warm bread, and she has even opened a bottle of wine to thank them for coming to their aid. Oleg makes sure to keep busy repairing a leak in the roof over the guesthouse (area @UUID[.fTB6r42OJIsE5Y3e]). When he sees the PCs, he climbs down to greet them, all sweaty and gruff. While Oleg likes the idea of having extra help to defend against the bandits, he’s disturbed by the implications of authorities sending anyone to “explore the Greenbelt.” Even though the bandits have been causing him trouble, he doesn’t welcome even the hint of an attempt by Restov to expand civilization into the Stolen Lands, for this would engulf his new home back into the society he’s worked so hard to avoid. But he knows better than to voice his opinions aloud, so opts instead for a gruff attitude, leaving the majority of the interaction with the PCs to his wife. Svetlana tells them she’s expecting the bandits to arrive in the morning for their monthly “tax collection,” and if the PCs are willing to help, she’ll give the adventurers free room and board—an offer that Oleg mutters unhappily about but knows better than to countermand.</p><p>Once the characters agree to help, the Levetons can tell them what they know about the bandits.</p><section class=\"dialogue\"><p><strong>First Visit</strong>: The bandits’ first visit was three months ago—they threatened to burn down the trading post if the Levetons didn’t agree to hand over all of the furs and trade goods they’d accumulated from various hunters and trappers.</p><p><strong>Subsequent Visits</strong>: Since then, the bandits have returned twice more, each time within an hour of sunrise on the first day of the month. The Levetons have learned to have their “taxes” ready and hand them over quickly—the bandits always seem eager to return to their camp somewhere to the south in the Greenbelt, which makes Svetlana think their camp is about a day’s ride away.</p><p><strong>Bandit Numbers</strong>: The first time the bandits visited, there were a dozen of them—10 lower-ranking criminals led by a cloaked man armed with a bow and a woman who carried two hatchets. The woman did the majority of the talking on that first trip, and her black sense of humor coupled with the way she smiled when she spoke of the fate awaiting the Levetons if they didn’t comply frightened the two all the more. The woman seemed particularly sharp and observant, whereas the man seemed a bit more crude and foolish. This, plus the fact that the woman quite nearly lopped off Oleg’s right hand with one of her hatchets in a cruel bit of mockery, convinced the Levetons she was the most dangerous of the bandits. As it was, the woman grabbed Svetlana’s wedding ring right off her finger and tossed it to one of her men as payment for “not shortening Oleg’s reach.”</p><p>On the second and third visits, only the crude, hooded man accompanied the bandits. On the second visit, he came with just six other men, while on the third, he came with only four. The Levetons suspect that the bandits have let down their guard and think the owners of the trading post are completely cowed. Hopefully, when they visit tomorrow, they’ll be even fewer in number, and the scary woman with the hatchets won’t be with them!</p></section>"

The Levetons suggest the PCs hide in the guesthouse or the stable and wait until the bandits busy themselves loading furs and other goods onto their horses, then the PCs can rush out of hiding to attack them.</p><p>The Levetons have no love for their tormentors and hope to see them all dead. Oleg even has plans to hang the bandits’ bodies from the southern palisade wall as a warning to other brigands. Still, Oleg stresses that neither he nor his wife are soldiers and won’t aid in any plan that puts them or the trading post in additional danger or that doesn’t end up at least teaching the bandits to seek easier victims elsewhere. Give the PCs whatever time they need to plan their ambush, allowing them to explore the trading post and come up with uses for the supplies and buildings found therein.</p><h3>The Bandits Arrive</h3><p>Once the PCs establish a plan, three bandits under the command of @UUID[Actor.y5W2rrHzQmeSE6LU] arrive as expected. About an hour after sunrise, the four brigands approach from the south on horseback. If the gate to the trading post isn’t open, they array themselves nearby and call out threats to the Levetons such as, “Open the gates, unless you want us to throw in a little fire to speed your arses up!” The bandits don’t expect any sort of resistance. If the trading post is open to them, they arrogantly ride in and begin making crude comments and threats against the Levetons while loading their horses. Left to their own devices, they finish the job in 20 minutes and leave the Levetons physically unharmed but emotionally devastated.</p><p>Happs is a crude and foul-mouthed man who turned to banditry after he was caught running a protection racket in Restov while serving as a soldier and city guard. He fled the city when he learned that the law was coming for him, abandoning his wife and two children to suffer the shame of his crimes. He’s found that banditry agrees with him—he quite enjoys the outdoors and Kressle’s companionship.</p><p><strong>If the PCs decide to ambush the bandits</strong> as they load their spoils, Oleg agrees to begin the interaction with them as usual, but he wants Svetlana to hide in the safety of their bedroom. Svetlana immediately points out that her absence would surely alert the bandits that something is up, and Oleg is forced to agree. Ultimately, who ends up where is left to the PCs, but if one of the Levetons hides, all skill checks involving tricking the bandits (including Stealth checks made as initiative checks) suffer a cumulative –1 circumstance penalty.</p><p>Once the fighting starts, Oleg and Svetlana both run for cover—you can assume they remain safely out of combat for the battle’s duration. The bandits aren’t expecting resistance, so for initiative, allow each PC to choose any skill appropriate for their chosen tactics, such as Deception, Stealth, or Survival. In addition, the bandits themselves are so agog at being ambushed that they suffer a –2 circumstance bonus on their initiative checks and are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg] during the first round of combat.</p><p><strong>If the characters don’t bother hiding and decide to confront the bandits openly</strong>, they lose these elements of surprise. The bandits don’t immediately attack, but quickly raise their guard. They pretend to be simple travelers seeking a quick breakfast and maybe a few hours of rest. If these circumstances force Oleg and Svetlana to interact with the bandits, either the Levetons endure their mistreatment (if Oleg feels Svetlana is at risk) or Oleg foolishly roars and attacks one of the bandits in an attempt to force a confrontation. If the PCs try to just wait out the bandits, they thank the Levetons for their food and leave without revealing their true purpose. Two days later, Happs returns with five bandits to try again. If the characters are still present, Happs and his bandits act more aggressively and add “rob the clueless strangers” to their list of crimes for the day. These circumstances cause Oleg and Svetlana to grow less friendly and more concerned that the “heroes” who have come to their home might not be any better than the bandits.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><aside class=\"right token wide\"><img class=\"flip\" src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/kingmaker/happs-bydon.webp\" /><h3>Creatures</h3><ul><li>@UUID[Actor.y5W2rrHzQmeSE6LU]</li><li>@UUID[Actor.7bWjM5e9sKxaYbOw]</li><li>@UUID[Actor.In2nNwo3JL1RXQhj]</li></ul></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>Encounter</h3><p>Moderate 1</p></header><p>Happs is overconfident and enjoys boasting during battle, calling out attacks and hollow threats that he’s ill-equipped to carry out. As the battle progresses, if his called attacks and threats continue to fail, he grows increasingly grim and quiet. He prefers to fight with his longbow, letting his bandits take the risks in melee. He uses his alchemist’s fire against PCs in a tight group or against the stables as a distraction to draw the PCs out of combat and into firefighting or panicked horse control. The bandits themselves are classic bullies, eager to inflict pain but cowards at heart. They do their best to team up and flank foes at the start of a fight, but sometimes make poor tactical decisions (such as to waste rounds of combat chasing a foe at range rather than switching to longbows, or sometimes switching targets and leaving other bandits without a flanking partner).</p><p>Happs knows his position as second-in-command in the Thorn River bandits is tenuous at best. He hopes that a few more months of robbing the trading post will earn him a promotion, so he won’t back down from a fight in front of his flunkies—as long as another bandit can see him, he fights to the death. The other bandits aren’t as committed to the cause; they shriek in pain and fear when reduced to fewer than 6 Hit Points and attempt to flee back to the @UUID[.Pt8wQRfepNlqTsio], on horseback if possible.

Two key phrases are noted below.</p><p><strong>Master Phrase</strong>: The bandits use this phrase to identify themselves to whomever is working the main gate. When spoken, the gate opens. The Stag Lord changes the phrase regularly as a safety precaution, or in the event he believes the phrase has been compromised. The current master phrase is “By the bloody bones of Saint Gilmorg, who wants to know?”</p><p><strong>Infiltrated Phrase</strong>: Bandits speak this phrase if they believe an outsider has infiltrated their ranks or they suspect a traitor. The current infiltrated phrase is “And so the stink marks the jackal in a den of wolves.”</p></aside><p>Although the bandits involved in the attack on Oleg’s Trading Post, the bandits stationed at the Thorn River camp, and the bandits the characters might run into as wandering monsters all serve the Stag Lord, only a select few are allowed to live in the fort with him: three lieutenants and seven other bandits. If the PCs manage to thin their ranks via multiple forays against the fort, assume that enough bandits roam the hills for the Stag Lord to replenish [[/r 1d6]] bandits each day; he cannot replace his three officers.</p><p>Although the seven bandits are identical as far as game statistics go, they remain unique individuals. Listed below are brief descriptions of each bandit—you can use these notes to give each a personality, especially if the PCs decide to infiltrate the fort disguised as new bandit recruits.</p><p><strong>Ayles Megesen</strong>: Ayles is a soft-spoken man whose calm demeanor should not be taken for passivity. Ayles enjoys the act of torture the most among the bandits, and often spends hours after a fight “exploring” surviving victims.</p><p><strong>Cragger Kench</strong>: A former cutpurse, Cragger was beaten senseless by the Stag Lord for stealing and drinking a bottle of his liquor. His injuries have left him resentful and cautious with concern to provoking his leader's wrath—causing him to take long pauses before speaking.</p><p><strong>Backhanded Jeb Megesen</strong>: Ayle's younger brother, Backhanded Jeb believes he got his nickname for the powerful strike he's accustomed to unleashing on foes, when in fact he earned his moniker by talking out both sides of his mouth.</p><p><strong>Falgrim Sneeg</strong>: Falgrim Sneeg is an older Varisian man with graying hair and an unruly beard. A former mercenary, he possesses an unnerving calm in the face of violence. He is the target of Kesten Garess’s plot for revenge (more information can be found in the Finding Falgrim quest on page 54).</p><p><strong>Norry “Gorgon” Driper</strong>: Smaller than only Auchs, Norry tends to snort and rumble like an enraged bull, exhibit clumsiness in rooms full of fragile treasure, and sport rancid breath that his fellow bandits claim could easily petrify the living. He wanted \"Ox\" as his nickname in the band, but alas, it was already taken.</p><p><strong>Jex the Snitch</strong>: The least popular with the men but perhaps the Stag Lord’s favorite minion is this aptly nicknamed man. His penchant for reporting the other bandits’ mistakes to the Stag Lord is likely to earn him a shallow grave before long.</p><p><strong>Topper Red</strong>: Topper Red was a struggling street poet from Pitax. He fled that city when an affair turned sour, and he eventually joined the Stag Lord’s ranks while romanticizing the thrilling life of a lawless brigand.</p><h3>The Lieutenants</h3><p>In addition to the seven rank-and-file bandits, the Stag Lord keeps three notable lieutenants on hand, each for a different reason. Orders from any of these three men are generally followed without hesitation; only when an order directly contradicts the Stag Lord’s commands (implied or otherwise) will the other bandits question a lieutenant.</p><p><strong>Akiros Ismort</strong>: Of the three lieutenants, Akiros is the least satisfied with his lot in life—but that’s nothing new for him. Akiros’s parents were simple farmers in a proud rural area in Taldor, and they wanted to raise him to be a protector of the town—as a paladin of Erastil, no less. Every moment of Akiros’s life was spent in preparation for his acceptance into the order, yet not one month after he achieved his parents’ dream and became a paladin, Akiros fell in love with the married daughter of one of his hometown’s wealthier merchants, a woman named Rosilla. The affair ended all too soon when Rosilla’s husband found out and confronted Akiros in public. When Rosilla publicly announced that the fling with Akiros was a mistake, the would-be paladin’s true nature came to the surface: He flew into a fury and killed both Rosilla and her husband. With dozens of witnesses in shock at his unexpected violence, he fled his hometown forever.</p><p>Akiros barely made it out of Taldor, stowing away on a merchant ship bound up the Sellen River for Mendev. Akiros switched ships dozens of times as he fled north, losing himself in the River Kingdoms, living as a bandit, a vagabond, and a criminal, where he grew to enjoy his newfound rages. Recently, his wanderings took him into the Stolen Lands. He’d heard of the Stag Lord and, still unsure of where he needed to be in life, he sought out this new liege. Akiros has been with the Stag Lord only a few months, but already his commanding presence has earned the leader’s favor; Akiros is now second-in-command, much to Dovan’s displeasure. Ironically, Akiros has come to the realization that life as a bandit is even more hollow than his life as a paladin of Erastil was, and when the PCs make their attack on the fort, he sees in them an opportunity for a new life and, perhaps, redemption. At some point, once the battle for the fort begins, you should have Akiros tear the Stag Lord amulet from his throat, cast it aside, and step in to fight with the characters. This can either be at a point where things are looking bad for the characters and they could use a little extra help, or it can be at the start of the battle.</p><p><strong>Auchs</strong>: Auchs is as simple as Akiros is complex. A lumbering lummox of a man, Auchs is simpleminded in everything but cruelty. He loves the sound of sobbing and screaming when the sounds aren’t coming from him, and he gleefully crushes and pummels bandits and prisoners alike according to the commands of his fellow lieutenants or the Stag Lord. Illiterate, Auchs can spell only his name—and he’s no longer sure about that, since Dovan gleefully taunted him that it’s spelled “Ox.” He’s traveled with Dovan for the past six months, ever since the smaller man saved him from being killed for starting a deadly brawl in a Daggermark marketplace. Auchs is rarely far from Dovan’s side, although he is taking an increasing liking to Akiros (much to Akiros’s annoyance).</p><p><strong>Dovan from Nisroch</strong>: Until Akiros usurped the role, Dovan was comfortably the second-in-command of the fort. Secretly pleased with the Stag Lord’s alcoholism, Dovan has been actively encouraging the man to drink, for as long as the Stag Lord is in his cups, more power over the bandits rests in Dovan’s hands. Dovan himself is a mystery to the bandits—a dark, tattooed figure with an obvious taste for pain and cruelty. All they know of him is that he claims to hail from Nisroch.</p><p>In fact, Dovan hails from Ustalav, where he grew up amid the horrors of the Widow’s Boudoir in Caliphas. When he discovered that he was on the menu for a particularly violent evening, Dovan gathered his things and quietly fled town, spending the next several months enjoying all the decadences and freedoms the River Kingdoms had to offer. After a close call with a press gang, Dovan “recruited” Auchs by saving the huge man from a brawl Dovan engineered. Dovan often grows tired of Auchs’s childish talk but is just as pleased with how well the oaf takes to torture—and the security his friendship brings can’t be denied. Of late, Dovan has been plotting ways to kill Akiros, but he can see how much the Stag Lord and the other bandits admire him, so he knows he needs to make his move subtly. Before the PCs arrived, his best idea was to somehow get Auchs to attack and kill the fallen paladin, but he has yet to come upon a reliable way to goad Auchs into attacking Akiros.</p>"

An all-out brawl with all 10 bandits is beyond an Extreme 3 encounter, so if your group is only 3rd level you should strive to have the bandits rally in waves rather than forcing the PCs to take them all on at once. As a general rule, it’s best if the PCs don’t face all three of the lieutenants at once. Of course, canny PCs will find ways to turn the lieutenants against each other, or even recruit one to their side!</p><p>Once the Stag Lord himself enters the battle, he can quickly overwhelm the situation. As a result, you should either time his entrance for after the PCs have defeated most of the other bandits or have recruited “aid” in the form of an angry owlbear or defecting lieutenant. Alternatively, when he enters the battle, you can simply have the other bandits step back out of fearful respect to let the Stag Lord fight without implying he needs help.</p></aside><p>The PCs can learn the location of the Stag Lord’s fort by interrogating bandits or simply exploring—it’s a landmark on its own, after all, and difficult to miss once one reaches the largest lake in the Greenbelt. It is located at area @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.rfqqwXigGo3EVybY] on the map of the Stolen Lands.</p><p>Full details on the Stag Lord can be found in his @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.70FiR5COVuuS28ZD].</p><h2>Methods of Approach</h2><p>The method the characters settle on for approaching and handling the Stag Lord’s fort is up to them, but two options are particularly likely.</p><h3>Infiltration</h3><p>The characters might bank on the fact that the bandits at the fort don’t know all the bandits who work for the Stag Lord in the Stolen Lands. Certainly, if they learn the master phrase from the bandits at the Thorn River camp, they’ll have a ticket into the fort. By dressing in defeated bandits’ clothes and openly displaying a stash of supposedly stolen goods, the characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus on checks made to Disguise themselves as bandits or Lie about their motives; if they display the alcohol from the Thorn River camp, the results of those checks are shifted up one degree of success.</p><p>News of an alcohol delivery spreads swiftly, causing the Stag Lord to emerge joyfully from his room in area C8, seize the liquor, and instruct Akiros to “pay these fine people a bonus of 5 gold coins each” before he returns to his quarters to drink himself into a stupor. It takes the Stag Lord an hour to pass out, at which point stealthy characters might even steal into his chamber and ambush the slumbering bandit lord. Poisoning the liquor is also a potential solution for taking out the Stag Lord. If any such attempt fails to kill the Stag Lord, though, he wakens filled with anger and calls for full support, in which case the PCs might find themselves fighting the entire bandit camp at once.</p><p>Particularly crafty characters could work to lure away individual bandits to a secluded place to kill, incapacitate, or even recruit them. They could even try to sow seeds of dissent—if the characters interact with the bandits and learn their personalities, getting the bandits to turn on one another proves a very real option, provided the characters are able to succeed at enough Diplomacy checks to Make an Impression or Request, Deception to Lie to plant the idea of insurrection, or Intimidation to Coerce a bandit into taking action.</p><h3>Assault</h3><p>The Stag Lord’s fort is heavily defended, and even if the characters can get inside the walls, the bandits are wily and tenacious foes. A combination of infiltration (to get inside) and assault (once the characters are in position) might work the best. Once a fight begins, the bandits raise the alarm by shouting, but the Stag Lord himself doesn’t immediately respond, misinterpreting the alarm for general bandit roughhousing and then fighting against a sudden bout of sickness and dizziness from his latest binge. You can thus delay the Stag Lord’s entrance into the battle for a particularly dramatic moment—perhaps just as the characters think they’re about done with the fight, or after they suddenly gain Akiros’s aid, or maybe even as they’re trying to flee. With the death of the Stag Lord, the will of the remaining bandits breaks and they flee the fort quickly, not eager to face justice at the PCs’ hands. In this event, only Akiros stays behind to offer the characters his continued aid. Dovan and Auchs flee with the rest, although Dovan could well return later on to plague the characters, particularly if one of them caught his eye as a possible victim to torture (Dovan prefers elves for this grisly pursuit).</p>"

Yet when the monks lapsed from proper worship and began to leave their cruel ways behind in favor of a more minimalist monastic lifestyle, Gyronna grew insulted. One night, she caused the dead of the monastery’s extensive graveyard (which surrounded the monastery on the south, east, and west hillsides) to rise up and attack the monks, dragging their still-living bodies into the earth and leaving the building abandoned.</p><p>The unquiet dead still lurk in the soil of the surrounding hillside, even though their unmarked graves are forgotten. The bandits learned the hard way that the former residents do not take kindly to intrusions upon their place of interment—while the main path to the fort doesn’t encroach on any burial sites, approaching from any other landward route rouses the undead guardians.

Imprisoned and abused at the hands of his son, Nugrah spends most of his time in a nest made of ropes, rags, and furs at the far end of area C11c.</p><p>In his youth, Nugrah belonged to the Green Faith, but when his wife Keirthe died in childbirth, Nugrah turned his back on that order. He turned to forbidden rituals in an ill-advised attempt to bring back his wife by sacrificing a fellow druid in an effort to “trade” his wife’s death for the druid’s. Appalled by his monstrous acts, Keirthe’s spirit appeared before him, cursed his name, then departed forever into the afterlife. Soon after, the other members of his circle of druids discovered his act and confronted him on the spot.</p><p>The Green Faith banished him from the order, sparing Nugrah’s life only that he might care for his infant son. He converted to the worship of Gozreh, finding strange solace in the violence and impassive cruelty in nature, and in the years that followed, Nugrah increasingly blamed his son for his misfortunes and treated him as one of the very animals he increasingly grew to see as untrustworthy beasts. Often, he threatened to kill his son, and made murderous attempts on more than one occasion, such as by leaving him outside in the winter or beating him bloody. Once, Nugrah tortured the child near to death by dousing him with acid. This event left his son so gruesomely scarred that for years the boy covered his frightful face with a burlap sack.</p><p>Then, one night, the relationship between the two shifted. His son had become a man, one physically and emotionally scarred with terrible, dark desires, and after a near-fatal beating Nugrah realized that he had become the victim in the family. In sour and sickly vengeance, his son, now known as the Stag Lord, deals him the same hand the old man once forced him to play. Nugrah now lives in fear of the son who mercilessly keeps him alive to endure his fate.</p><p>Today, Nugrah obeys his son’s commands to guard the treasures kept here, otherwise passing the time crafting twisted fetishes and praying to Gozreh for an end to his wretched existence even as he lacks the courage to take back his own life.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><aside class=\"right porthole wide\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/kingmaker/nugrah.webp\" /></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>@UUID[Actor.KP7uf1E8CQgzTuQy]</h3><p>Moderate 3</p></header><p>As soon as Nugrah notices intruders entering the cellar, he casts <em>meld into stone</em> to step into the southern wall of area C11c to listen and wait.

All that booze under the platform is for him. He’s half of what he used to be, and he ain’t never been right in the head. I hear he punched a horse for spittin’ in the yard a few weeks ago. Personally, I wouldn’t care if he dropped dead tomorrow, but even drunk out of his mind, he’s still got a fair amount of fight to him.”</p><p><strong>Who’s the Stag Lord’s boss? Are there any other bosses?</strong> “The Stag Lord keeps a strange old man locked up in the basement. I suspect the old guy might actually be running the show, using the Stag Lord as a puppet, you know. I got a look into the old guy’s eyes once, and it terrified me. He ain’t someone I’d want to cross.”</p><p><strong>Where’s Svetlana’s Ring?</strong> “A couple of bags of loot were stolen a while back by a group of filthy gremlins—the annoying little pests live under the old sycamore tree to the east. We were lucky that what they snatched was mostly just copper and some cheap-looking trinkets, otherwise the Stag Lord would have our skins for sure! That ring we took from the trader woman was in there, though, I’m sure of it.”</p><p><strong>Will you help us fight the Stag Lord?</strong> The bandits fear the Stag Lord, and if this topic comes up, they blanch and shake their heads in fear.</p></section>"

A band of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.aipkJQxP4GBsTaGq] worshippers called the Cult of the Bloom seeks to make an offering to the Mother of Monsters by sacrificing the citizens of the kingdom to her glory. They plan to accomplish this by converting the Stolen Lands into a region of marauding monsters by capitalizing on the region’s growing connection to the raw forces of life itself in the First World.</p><p>The method of corrupting energies from the First World to further the demands of Lamashtu came to a fanatical cleric named @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.feVqesGobG3L2VZO] in the form of a ritual learned during a series of fevered meditations. Whether or not this ritual, monstrous bloom, was actually sent to him by Lamashtu herself as Darivan claims, it is both effective and awful in its effects. Its power allowed Darivan to gather a sizable following and bring them into the Stolen Lands. The cult has settled their base of operations in a @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.x9akvOBdMxgcO2xg] in the western foothills of the Tors of Levenies. Their prayers and ceremonies, combined with the use of the monstrous bloom ritual, have cursed the ground there, creating the first of the cursed bloom pods—plants the cult can use to spread their influence throughout the Stolen Lands.</p><p>The nature of the curse is as horrifying as it is insidious. Darivan’s seeds corrupt the meat of any animal that eats them. Any predator who eats a pod-infected creature in turn is also cursed, including humanoids all the way up the compromised food chain. This infestation takes root within, growing in the flesh of the victims and eroding their minds, causing them to become increasingly wild and emotional. The curse itself isn’t particularly efficient as it spreads out through the environment—for most of those who become infected, the sensation manifests as little more than a temporary lapse of inhibitions followed by belly aches—but for those who are particularly susceptible through chance or fate, the curse takes root and eventually uses the body to fuel a burst of energies from the fecund planes of the First World and the Abyss alike. The result is a spectacular explosion as the creature transforms from within into a writhing tangle of alien plants from the heart of which emerges a ravenous monster that immediately sets out to hunt. With Lamashtu’s blessing, these seeds of ruin will blossom into a brand-new season in the Stolen Lands—the Season of Bloom.</p><aside><h3>Kingdom in the Background</h3><p>This chapter assumes that the citizens are pleased with their new rulers after having been saved from the predations of monsters and trolls. Festive feelings and hopefulness are everywhere, and the invitation to the PCs to take part in the hunt is but one manifestation of this. But as this chapter progresses, the kingdom begins to suffer heavily from the fear that anyone could suddenly transform into a monster, causing the citizens to look to their leaders more than ever, not only for protection, but for a solution to the horrors.</p><p>The kingdom expands in size during this chapter to encompass Zones 1 through 5, with some expansion into Zone 6. The nation’s capital of Shrikewall has already expanded into a town in Zone 3, but it isn’t quite at the level of a city yet. Olegton in Zone 1 also gains town status, as does @UUID[JournalEntry.hg9Bztz48jKxb8K6.JournalEntryPage.H7wXdZVu3jbnZrIk] in Zone 2.

The monsters at area @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.SCbb3uIL4P5qzSD1] have been causing difficulty for river trade to Silvershore, so defeating them later in Part 1 of this chapter will be particularly helpful.</p></aside>"

Following the introductions, Jamel informs the PCs they have a little time to mingle and chat while the lodge’s staff prepares the evening’s meal. If the PCs arrived on horseback, a former farmhand named Timol sees that their mounts are tended to. Jamel and the invited guests spend the hour relaxing in the outdoor seating area surrounding the lodge.

Dinner is prepared by a talented, grizzled man named Orline and served by Timol. The food is robust and tasty but not that fancy; Annamede is amused, commenting that the “rustic presentation adds an unusual texture to the flavor of the feast.” A recurring conversation topic during dinner is Jamel’s difficulty in deciding on a name for the hunting lodge, which the Travelers would like to open as a public tavern; he invites everyone to offer suggestions, but he isn’t quite ready to make a final decision.</p><h3>Round 3: Preparations for the Hunt</h3><p>As dinner winds down, mugs of cider, coffee, and tea are offered alongside cheese and fruit. Jamel requests everyone’s attention and explains why he arranged this hunt. The Embeth Travelers found a grievously wounded local named Vath Locher washed up on the shore of the Gudrin River; the man perished from his wounds soon after imparting a warning about the wyvern that attacked his family in their cabin upriver. The Travelers investigated but broke off their hunt after discovering evidence of two additional monsters in the area: a hydra and a krooth. Faced with a greater concentration of threats than he was comfortable handling with his own group, Jamel initiated this gathering to make a friendly competition out of it.</p><section class=\"treasure\"><p><strong>The Prize</strong>: At this point, he produces a @UUID[Actor.gfqenBp0Q6p9ctVr] and explains that the group that makes the most monster kills tomorrow shall win a prize: 80 gp, a returning weapon runestone, and a wand of cure moderate wounds.

In another few weeks, this effect will fade entirely, and surviving creatures in the region will need to hunt for their food.</p></aside><p>The region the Embeth Travelers have identified as dangerous and infested with monsters—the hunting grounds—is located upriver from the lodge on the Gudrin River, at location @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.SCbb3uIL4P5qzSD1].</p><p>An hour before sunrise, the hunting party boards the Embeth Travelers’ barge and heads upriver to the western edge of the hunting grounds. During the trip, Jamel lays out the rules for the competition: The Travelers know of three specific monsters in the region—a wyvern, a hydra, and a krooth—though they suspect there are other dangers. The groups have until noon the next day to return to the barge with proof of their kills—the three monsters the Travelers have targeted or others they haven’t yet discovered—at which point the group that has secured the greatest success is declared the winner.</p><p>The journey is uneventful, and at midday, the barge anchors at a small island in the river. From this starting point at the south end of the hunting grounds, the group can see a ruined shack to the west (area @UUID[.1IOB279quVKk8MnF]), cliffsides to the northwest (areas @UUID[.HlZK9RDB45YWNzjx] and @UUID[.tSxDRUqoSBcFrtOp]), a rise to the north that dips down into what may be an obscured hollow (area @UUID[.V56kPQxrKdF7lv9Z]), and an escarpment on the river’s eastern shore (area @UUID[.hZYUuhPjY7bJrzL9]). Jamel tells the hunting party that the shack belonged to the family of Vath Locher—the local who was recently killed—and that the Travelers have not yet given it a good look over.</p><p>Annamede and her two bodyguards head east up the river. She has no intention of hunting and wants only to spend the time relaxing while she watches events play out in the valley below, lazily gathering information about the PCs and the others (area @UUID[.hZYUuhPjY7bJrzL9]).</p><p>The Aldori sisters head directly north. It’s not long before they’re in a fight for their lives (area @UUID[.V56kPQxrKdF7lv9Z]).</p><p>The three rangers Jamel brought to represent the Embeth Travelers in the contest head upriver along the northern bank in search of the krooth (area @UUID[.ay5iUIN6ZnC0RN7P]). Jamel himself stays at the barge, which is a safe place for any hunter to rest or recover during the hunt.</p><p>The route the PCs take is left up to them, but if they attempt to accompany the Aldoris or the Embeth Travelers, the other hunters bristle and suggest the PCs “seek their own prey.” Annamede welcomes company if the PCs have managed to gain at least 2 points of influence with her, but she makes clear to them her intent to not hunt and instead spend the day relaxing “on that lovely escarpment upriver.” She isn’t interested in helping the PCs hunt. If the PCs haven’t managed to gain any influence with Annamede, she instead rebuffs them, observing that they should probably head north into the woods and bristly thickets, snidely observing that “You’re all dressed for all of that filthy bushcraft nonsense, after all.”</p><h2>Exploring the Hunting Grounds</h2><p>The hunting grounds have an unusually high density of monsters; this is the result of several creatures succumbing to the Bloom. A typical party can cover ground in this area relatively quickly, but the high density of dangerous monsters is likely to reduce PC resources faster, to the point they may need to rest for the night to recover resources and heal up. Since the monsters in the area are still adjusting to their new lives, they haven’t yet come into direct conflict with each other. If the PCs choose to make camp within 300 feet (4 squares) of a monster lair, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:6]; if you succeed, that creature comes to investigate and attacks the camp at some point during the night.</p><section class=\"skill\"><header><h3>The Source of the Monsters</h3></header><p>After the PCs have spent 4 hours in the hunting grounds or have earned at least 2 Hunt points (Winning the Hunt, below), the PCs can attempt a @Check[type:nature|dc:22|traits:action:recall-knowledge] or @Check[type:hunting-lore|dc:18|traits:action:recall-knowledge] or a @Check[type:nature|dc:22|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo].</p><p><strong>On a success</strong>, the character notes that the high concentration of apex predators in the area is not only unusual, it’s unnatural—especially considering evidence that these monsters don’t often travel far from their lairs to hunt.</p><p><strong>On a critical success</strong>, the PC also notes how unusually lush the vegetation is in the area, as if the plants were receiving some strange source of nutrient that bolstered their growth. If this information is noted, a successful @Check[type:nature|dc:27|traits:action:recall-knowledge] or @Check[type:first-world-lore|dc:22|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check confirms that this entire area seems to have been infused with life-giving energies from the First World, which may explain why the plants are so lush and the creatures seem to lack the compulsion to go out and hunt—this infusion seems to be providing the local flora and fauna with sustenance. Beyond this, the PCs must investigate the source of these effects at area @UUID[.tSxDRUqoSBcFrtOp] to learn more.</p></section><h2>Winning the Hunt</h2><p>Each time the PCs slay a monster whose level is equal to or higher than the party’s level, they earn one Hunt point. In a few encounters, the PCs can earn additional Hunt points by helping NPCs. To win the hunt, the PCs must earn a minimum of 3 Hunt points before the hunt ends the following noon.</p><h2>Finishing the Hunt</h2><p>At noon, the day after the hunt begins, the event draws to a close. The surviving hunters return to Jamel’s barge on the river island at the southern edge of the hunting grounds to compare stories and trophies. If any hunters fail to return, Jamel recruits the PCs to help him look for them for a few hours before heading back.</p><p>In order to win the hunt, the PCs must have accumulated 3 Hunt points—slaying the hydra, the wyvern, and the krooth are enough to win, for example, with Glazulin the winter wolf and the weakened giant flytrap being other opportunities for bonus points. If the PCs failed to achieve 3 Hunt points, the Embeth Travelers win the competition. The Aldori sisters, at best, manage only the hydra (and may well have died), while Annamede never bothered trying to win at all.</p><p>Jamel invites the hunters to return to the Travelers’ lodge for another feast celebrating the hunters’ accomplishments (and mourning their losses, if any), where he’ll present the promised @UUID[Actor.gfqenBp0Q6p9ctVr] to the winning team. The barge makes it back to the lodge just at sunset, with most of the hunters ravenous for a meal and eager for a good night’s rest in comfortable beds.</p>"

They’ve performed monstrous bloom rituals in numerous locations throughout the Stolen Lands, and their focus now shifts toward “curation” of their victims. Whereas the primary victims of the bloom have so far been wild animals, the curse is beginning to afflict humanoids with alarming frequency. The fate of poor Timol serves as a sudden warning to the PCs about the danger facing their kingdom.</p><p>In order to defeat the cult, the PCs must learn not only the location of their hideout in the foothills of the Tors of Levenies, but also the nature of the curse itself. While the PCs may fear that they are themselves in danger of succumbing to the curse, the way this chapter is presented leaves it entirely in the GM’s hands who does and doesn’t succumb. Season of Bloom assumes the PCs are never truly in danger of becoming infected by this affliction, but the players themselves shouldn’t know this.</p><p>The best place to learn more of the cult and their secrets is the small, remote goblin village of @UUID[.L9v0W92VWu8BdxQv], a stockade settlement that has recently fallen under the cult’s control. The cultists hope to use Greengripe as a sort of smoke screen, so that when the heroes of the land inevitably seek to stop it, they’ll mistake the source of the cult as coming from the goblins rather than the actual perpetrators. What the cultists don’t count on is the Greengripe goblins’ potential willingness to ask the PCs for help—that is, once the characters follow up on the clues the cult left, which lead them to the goblins in the first place.</p><p>In order to learn more about the curse and its source—and eventually determine the best way to defeat it—the PCs must research clues, investigate rumors, and examine evidence using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.t5nBkpjroaq7QBGK] rules. Rather than performing this research in a single library, though, these investigations take place throughout the PCs’ kingdom and the surrounding Stolen Lands. And rather than having different divisions in a library to perform this research, the PCs must physically travel to one of several research sites where clues can be found.</p><p>Since much of this part of the chapter plays out over downtime and exploration mode, time will pass more quickly than it did in @UUID[.JO9Ouc5E80T9t2Al] of “Cult of the Bloom,” and it’s likely that the PCs will have at least one or more Kingdom turns during this part. Each time a Kingdom turn takes place during this part, a new @UUID[JournalEntry.dAtoyQhSfSBvjr2W.JournalEntryPage.pr1olkpuBA78fisx] continuous event automatically begins during the turn’s Event phase (in addition to any other events—random or otherwise—that would otherwise occur). If the PCs don’t handle the Cult of the Bloom soon, each following month brings a new automatic Monster Activity event to the Kingdom turn, which can quickly spiral out of control as the curse spreads.</p><h3>Discovering a Research Site</h3><p>There are several research sites the PCs can learn about in their quest to discover more about the Cult of the Bloom. At the start of @UUID[.yTJR4dc9eSM3RkZ5], the PCs already know of two research sites: the hunting grounds and the lodge where Timol met his fate. As they perform research at these sites, and as more bloom-related events occur, additional research sites open up for the PCs to investigate.</p><p>Researching at a site takes a day of work spent between on-site investigations, ruminating on the evidence, and supporting actions such as interviewing locals, consulting texts, praying for guidance, comparing theories, and so on.</p>"

These monsters don’t seem to be driven to violence out of an instinctual need to eat, but instead from a deeper, more sinister urge to cause pain. The PCs hear initial rumors that a cult is responsible for spreading the affliction through the region.</p><p><strong>10 Research Points</strong> The source of the affliction seems to be a sinister curse associated with conjuration magic. The victims don’t transform into these monsters—it’s more like their bodies are transformed into some sort of strange portal through which the creature is created. It seems that any living creature may be subject to this curse, but the method of its spread is unknown at this time. Rumors about a cult being responsible are now widespread; this cult is said to be based primarily in the wilderness, and it’s trying to return the Stolen Lands to the rule of monsters.</p><p><strong>15 Research Points</strong> Those who suffer the curse show no symptoms until near the end, when crippling pain ripples through their entire body. The type of creature that emerges from a victim’s body is unpredictable. It may be possible to save someone from the curse if the affliction can be detected before it runs its course, but doing so is difficult given the widespread nature of the curse. While a wide range of people are supposedly joining the cult, most of the rumors suggest the original cultists were goblins.</p><p><strong>20 Research Points</strong> Armed with their knowledge from previous research, the PCs confirm that the bodies spawning the strange plant growth and monsters also have tiny, difficult-to-spot black seeds embedded along their throats, esophagi, and stomach linings. These seeds seem to be mostly inert, but evidence suggests that it takes only one active seed to trigger the effect. The knowledge that the affliction is gained via ingestion is a breakthrough, and if the PCs make this knowledge available to the public, the kingdom’s citizens become more watchful of the food and water they take. At the same time, the PCs discover more evidence implicating goblin cultists said to keep a hideout somewhere in the Sellen Hills.</p><p><strong>25 Research Points</strong> The PCs confirm that when the curse is triggered, it transforms the victim’s body from the inside out into a portal to the First World that draws in a dangerous monster, but that the process infuses the monster with Abyssal energies as well. The combination of these planar energies from two particularly fecund planes is key to the curse’s power, but the element of chaos also present in the curse makes it, fortunately, unreliable. Most of those who become infected by the seeds never know it, but the number of so-called “blooms” is growing. The PCs also learn the location of the goblin village of @UUID[.L9v0W92VWu8BdxQv] in the Sellen Hills, with evidence suggesting it may be the genesis of the curse. If that’s the case, it’s quite likely that a method of undoing or neutralizing the curse entirely could be found there.</p><p><strong>30 Research Points</strong> The fact that this affliction seems to manifest so sporadically suggests that the cult spreading it hasn’t yet managed to fully integrate it into the region. It may be but a matter of time before every cursed seed that pollutes the region’s food and water supplies will transform those who ingest them! PCs who reach this research threshold also start to see deeper hints that the actual cult, known to them now (if they haven’t learned already) as the Cult of the Bloom, may be using the goblins of Greengripe as a scapegoat. Finally, the PCs’ research confirms that if they could find the site where the Cult first created this affliction, they could neutralize its effects in one fell swoop throughout the Stolen Lands.</p><p><strong>35 Research Points</strong> The PCs confirm that the Cult of the Bloom are worshipers of Lamashtu, and that while the goblins of Greengripe also worship the Mother of Monsters, their faith is very different than that pursued by the Cult. The goblins of Greengripe are certainly patsies for the cult, but there may be additional clues about the cult to be found there nonetheless. It’s very unlikely that the curse’s source is located in Greengripe.</p><p><strong>40 Research Points</strong> The Cult of the Bloom is using the goblins of Greengripe as a distraction. They’ve managed to keep the actual location of their headquarters very well hidden, but the PCs who reach this research threshold find strong evidence that the cult has a hidden agent among the goblins in Greengripe who is likely to know more about the cult’s true hideout. Finally, the PCs confirm that the curse’s source has been hidden in the true hideout.</p><p><strong>50 Research Points</strong> After studying enough clues, the PCs have narrowed down the most likely location of the cult’s base of operations: It’s somewhere in the foothills of the Tors of Levenies, directly south of the Little Sellen River. At this point, the PCs have exhausted their research; to discover anything more, they’ll have to either investigate Greengripe in person or discover the true cult headquarters on their own.</p></section>"

Their chosen home, situated atop a narrow mesa and surrounded by a solid wooden palisade, is inconveniently far from trade routes or villages (or at least, it had been until the PCs’ kingdom began to expand). More by accident than intent, this isolation has caused the Greengripe goblins to avoid antagonistic activities and pursue lives of self-sufficiency. They get all the water they need from a creek about a hundred feet north of the mesa that eventually flows into the Little Sellen River, and they learned to supplement their diet of local goats and deer with what was once a relatively robust pickling operation overseen by Greengripe’s lead alchemist.</p><p>Unfortunately for the goblins, the Cult of the Bloom’s manipulation of Greengripe has increasingly forced them into a desperate situation. @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.feVqesGobG3L2VZO], the leader of the Cult of the Bloom, knew that it would take time before the repetition of the monstrous bloom rituals would reach a point where the curse’s effects would cascade out of control. Until then, there would be a delicate phase where the PCs could potentially step in and halt the process before it could reach the tipping point. He chose the goblins of Greengripe as his smokescreen, laying clues that he hoped would distract the heroes into thinking that defeating the goblins would bring an end to the curse, when in fact that false sense of accomplishment would merely afford the curse the final few weeks or days it needed to reach full spread throughout the Stolen Lands.</p><aside class=\"right\"><h3>We’ve Seen This Before!</h3><p>If the PCs have handled the Sootscale problem and learned how Tartuccio deceived the kobolds by posing as a leader via shape-changing magic, they’ll notice clues and similarities to the situation in Greengripe even if they aren’t suspicious initially.

First, the fact that the PCs have already likely encountered this tactic before with @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR.JournalEntryPage.vUpVTeUCLoI4eDBG] invasion of the Sootscale kobolds is likely to make them more able to notice tactics to manipulate a society.

Village Gate</h2><p>The main entrance to Greengripe consists of a ramshackle gate made of lashed-together branches and twigs bound by lengths of thorny vine. Two wooden watchtowers have platforms about ten feet off the ground. A goblin warrior stands guard on each watchtower—see the @UUID[.9ZDIm5EcSG5qn02W] encounter for their reaction to the PCs. The gate itself is not actually attached to the watchtowers but is merely wedged in between the structures. Success on a @Check[type:athletics|dc:12|traits:action:force-open] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SjmKHgI7a5Z9JzBx] the gate wrenches it aside, or a character can take three Interact actions to wriggle it open (this is the option the goblins generally take to come and go from the village).</p><h2>B2. Pickle Storage</h2><p>One of the four permanent structures in Greengripe is this solid stone building. Within sit several barrels of pickled vegetables—emergency food stores for the village. The door to the structure is solid and kept “locked” with ropes tied between its handle and a nearby iron piton driven into the wall. Success on a @Check[type:athletics|dc:15|traits:action:force-open] check can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SjmKHgI7a5Z9JzBx] the door; otherwise it takes three Interact actions to unlock the door. While the contents of this building are not particularly valuable, the goblins are very protective of their pickles, and if they notice the PCs attempting to gain entry, they’ll confront them—see the @UUID[.9ZDIm5EcSG5qn02W] sidebar.</p><h2>B3. Cemetery</h2><p>This region of the village is Greengripe’s cemetery, consisting of dozens of low mounds of earth and stone where the goblins have traditionally buried their dead. The goblins haven’t bothered to adorn these locations with gravestones or other markers. Succeeding at a @Check[type:perception|dc:20] or @Check[type:survival|dc:20] check is all that’s needed to note that more than half the mounds here are fresh; these graves house victims of the fire (area B11). Persistent local goblin rumors that burning ghosts haunt the cemetery are purely tall tales, but that doesn’t keep the goblin citizens from keeping an eye out here in hopes of spotting a fiery spirit.</p><h2>B4. Goblin Homes</h2><p>A large collection of tents once occupied the east and west sections of Greengripe, but after a recent devastating fire at area B11, this grouping of wood-framed tents covered in hides and furs now houses the bulk of Greengripe’s 19 goblin warriors. At any given time, [[/gmroll 2d4]] goblin warriors can be found resting here.</p><h2>B5. Livestock</h2><p>The walls of this large pen consist of a relatively solid five-foot-high stick fence. The ground within is muddy. The goblins use this pen to keep animals they manage to capture alive for eventual use as food, but with fears of upcoming longshank attacks, the stock here has grown thin: a single muddy goat wanders aimlessly in here now. A goblin warrior is always perched on one of the fence posts surrounding the pen. “Goat-watching” is a pretty important job since the doomed goat is the tribe’s last reserve of fresh meat until the latest hunting party returns to the village. The goblins are eager to make sure the goat, who they’ve taken to calling “@UUID[Actor.44kBmkeNLsFYNvHu],” remains in place.</p><h2>B6. Marshalling Grounds</h2><p>This fenced-in area has hard-packed dirt, with several movable combat dummies made of straw and sticks scattered around the place. The goblins use this area to practice warcraft, and at any one time, [[/gmroll 2d4]] goblin warriors can be found here, taking turns at hacking away or repairing the human-sized dummies.</p><h2>B7. Lamashtu’s Rock</h2><p>A forty-foot-wide slab of stone protrudes five feet from the ground here. The goblins set two smaller slabs of stone along its southern side to serve as steps up to its surface, and they have long used the slab as an open-air temple to their goddess, Lamashtu. Along the slab’s edges stand seven tree trunks, each adorned with hides stripped from the bodies of Greengripe’s greatest victories over “monsters” (several of these are horse hides, but there are also a few crocodile hides, two owlbear hides, and even a hide from a manticore slain several generations ago by one of Greengripe’s founders). A ten-foot-tall stone statue of Lamashtu stands at the center of the rock; it has recently been adorned with a two-foot-high mound of earth surrounding its feet. Thick tangles of strange plants grow in this soil, their long creepers coiling up along the statue’s frame to shroud the figure in green vines and strangely colored flowers. Success on a @Check[type:nature|dc:25|traits:action:recall-knowledge] or @Check[type:first-world-lore|dc:20|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo] confirms these strange vines are not natural to this world but are intrusions from the First World that bear many similarities to the plants that grow out of creatures that burst to release bloom monsters. This addition to the statue is recent, placed by Virthad while disguised as Muglund to help convince the goblins that Lamashtu dwells in the very plants of the world (and also to make it appear that Greengripe has links to the cult). The plants wrapping the statue are strange and unsettling but ultimately harmless.</p><h2>B8. Lamashtu’s Shrine</h2><p>The largest building in Greengripe sits on a dozen solid tree-trunk stilts so that its floor is at an even level with Lamashtu’s Rock. The current occupant of this shrine is the doppelganger Virthad, disguised as the village’s priest-chieftain Muglund. The building itself is relatively empty save for a bed, a personal altar, and a @UUID[Actor.eAcqxMqPdau8dIlb] in which Virthad has secured Greengripe’s treasures; the doppelganger plans to return to the cult with this treasure as an offering to Lamashtu once Greengripe has outlived its usefulness. The chest isn’t locked and contains 1 pp, 37 gp, 190 sp, 800 cp, and 30 gp in gems and jewelry. One of the pieces of jewelry is a <em>ring of the ram</em>. See the @UUID[.3ndl1WhKJjTmRKfj] encounter for further details.</p><h2>B9. Craftsgoblin</h2><p>This small stone building houses Greengripe’s only remaining workshop (since the alchemy lab at area B11 burned down). A lone goblin war chanter named Zangel lives and works here; while she isn’t particularly skilled at crafting weapons, she’s the best Greengripe has since its previous crafter perished in the fire. She spends her time cobbling together dogslicers, arrows, bows, and other weapons or tools needed by the village, and has only recently managed to catch up to the demand. Zangel harbors concerns that Muglund might have “gone rotten,” and she has whispered her fears to a few other goblins. If the PCs manage to contact Zangel before the doppelganger confronts them, see the @UUID[.3ndl1WhKJjTmRKfj] encounter.</p><h2>B10. “Greenhouse”</h2><p>Greengripe’s previous alchemist perished in a tragic fire (area B11) that also burned down the laboratory. This structure, the newest building in Greengripe, was built by the goblins at “Muglund’s” command, with a promise that a new alchemist would be chosen soon. Until then, the doppelganger has forbidden any goblin from entering this building. As a result, the goblins have taken to viewing the “replacement” alchemy lab with a mix of curiosity and frustration, with each day that passes without a local alchemist to look to for inspiration weighing heavy on goblin morale.</p><p>Within, Virthad has set up several alchemical stations and strange potted plants to make it appear that the goblins have been using this building to grow the strange plants responsible for the affliction ravaging the lands. Any PC who examines the laboratory here and succeeds at a @Check[type:first-world-lore|dc:20|traits:action:recall-knowledge] or @Check[type:crafting|dc:20|traits:action:recall-knowledge] to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo] confirms that the equipment here seems to be focused on cultivating alien plant life, but there are no dangerous plants here at this time. As this is part of Virthad’s deception, the PCs may gain a bonus on these checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo] (see @UUID[.L9v0W92VWu8BdxQv]). A <strong>critical success</strong> at this check reveals to the PCs that the gear kept here is, in fact, not what one would expect, and that the whole greenhouse seems to be staged.</p><h2>B11. Burnt Buildings</h2><p>Soon after Virthad infiltrated the goblin village, the doppelganger realized that the village’s alchemist (and Greengripe’s local pickling expert) had a canny mind and would likely see through their deceptions. So Virthad lit the alchemy lab on fire under the cover of night, using the fire to dispose of Muglund’s body as well. The alchemist perished quickly, but the fire spread to several nearby goblin tents before it was contained. Ironically, Virthad’s use of magic to help extinguish the flames helped cement their deception as Muglund. The superstitious goblins have avoided this part of the village since the fire out of fear that the alchemist’s ghost might be haunting the area. If the PCs succeed at a @Check[type:perception|dc:25|traits:action:search|basic:true] while searching the laboratory ruins, they’ll find the partial skeleton of a goblin that still clutches a metallic object in its hand: a silver @UUID[Item.7adtL3iQNDm03WdN] worth 2 gp. If the PCs discover this evidence, they’ll have an easier time convincing the goblins of Greengripe to rise up against Virthad; see the @UUID[.3ndl1WhKJjTmRKfj] encounter.</p>"

Virthad takes advantage of any opportunity to escape and return to the cult.</p><p><strong>If the PCs slaughter the goblins</strong> or scatter them to the wilds, it’s likely that Virthad escapes the attack, in which case the PCs might find themselves at a dead end in tracking down the cult.

The PCs can, of course, still discover the cult lair on their own (such as by tracking a fleeing Virthad, simply stumbling upon the cult site while exploring, or by achieving a threshold of 50 RP by researching the cult), but each day after the PCs’ defeat of Virthad, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:20]; this DC drops by 3 each day that follows.

Despite the wide range of features that can cause breach scars, they remain incredibly rare events, and the fact that the First World itself works to heal these scars over time means that even when a breach scar does form, it almost never persists for more than a few years.</p><p>The breach scar in these caves is an exception to this rule, for before it could heal properly, it became “infected” by a taint from the Abyss when, several decades ago, a demonologist tried to capitalize on the fragility of reality to redirect the scar from the First World to the Abyss. The resulting backlash of magic obliterated the demonologist, but it did infect the breach scar and make it such that it simply couldn’t heal on its own.</p><p>Fortunately, the corrupted breach scar wasn’t enough to allow unaided intrusions across the planes, and so for years it simply festered in the caves until its presence was discovered by chance by a wandering druid named @UUID[Actor.jmH2nbWRJSYgzx5z], who noticed the strange fluctuations after performing a commune with nature ritual in the nearby foothills. He investigated, was shocked at what he found, and attempted to heal the breach scar on his own, but the same magical backlash that slew the demonologist lashed out at him, blasting away his arm. Jin died soon thereafter, his attempt to heal the scar worse than failing, for it was this pulse of energies that caught the attention of another: Darivan.</p><p>When he arrived at the caves, Darivan didn’t try to redirect or remove the scar’s energies; instead, he harnessed them and developed the monstrous bloom ritual to weave both the First World and the Abyss into a singular monstrosity—a bloom of Lamashtu.

He describes watching an elk across the river explode into a blast of plants, then watched as a giant multi-headed snake crawled out of the mess and slithered into the woods nearby. Glazulin suspects the other monsters came from similar places and suggests the PCs stay on the lookout for “exploded corpses” as proof. The winter wolf doesn’t know what’s causing these events or why the monsters aren’t expanding their territories, but he worries that his pack will need to relocate if the monsters grow more territorial.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><aside class=\"right token\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/npc/glazulin.webp\" /><ul><li>@UUID[Actor.w2Wtaq50DSlJ8qsG]</li><li>@UUID[Actor.Sft7n3LMmnTxhhYn]</li></ul></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>Encounter</h3><p>Moderate 6</p></header><p>Glazulin is sly and his voice drips with menace.

Jamel thanks all the hunters for participating and announces the new name of the hunting lodge he’s decided on—this should be a PC’s suggestion of your choice—but before the group can offer much in the way of congratulations to the winning suggestion, something horrific occurs.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>A sudden howl and scream interrupts the proceedings as Timol suddenly doubles over in pain, clutching at his stomach before tearing his shirt open to reveal protrusions moving under his skin. His ribs separate unevenly, as if something is forcing them apart from the inside. With a wild-eyed look of pain, Timol suddenly screams before exploding into a mass of coiling plants, vines, and vibrant wildflowers. From the midst of this sudden burst of verdant material crawls a hissing, eight-legged creature—a basilisk!</p></section><p>Timol has become the latest victim of the Cult of the Bloom, having inadvertently exposed himself to the curse several days ago by feasting on rabbits and drinking water from another infected stream similar to the one in the hunting grounds during his journey to the lodge to join its staff. When he ate some of the beast cooked for this feast, the curse took hold and used his body and his life to pull a powerful basilisk from the First World, infused it with Abyssal energies, and burst it forth into the midst of the lodge’s dining hall.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><aside class=\"right porthole thin\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/bestiaries/basilisk.webp\" /></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>@UUID[Actor.WJ0bMCZUHJVwKYG1]</h3><p>Severe 6</p></header><p>The freshly bloomed basilisk is a deadly threat to the entire group, so the surviving hunters all leap to join the battle as well.

The PCs will soon be seeing the room under very different conditions, and the effect will be all the stronger if they have grown used to its usual appearance.</p><p>This module also contains intact versions of the eastern and western wings, which you might need if your players begin to explore the manor before nightfall.</p></section><p>As this chapter begins, the PCs have answered @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.kv4bSiz3OfUFDXnM]’s “call for heroes” and arrived at her impressive hilltop manor. A cobblestone path, bordered by regal oak trees and well-manicured hedges, winds its way up the hill for nearly a mile, past a two-story guard barracks, the stables, and a dozen thatched-roof cottages that house the families of the manor’s servants and retainers. The manor itself is a sprawling, three-story structure constructed of light gray mortared stone, surrounded by hedge-lined rose gardens and ancient oak trees.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, ceilings within the manor are 10 feet high, and the interiors are illuminated by numerous cinnamon-scented oil lamps or wide windows set with panes of glass. The interior walls and ceilings are constructed of masonry and covered with a thin layer of white lime plaster adorned with a layer of wood paneling. The doors throughout the manor are reinforced wooden doors, kept unlocked unless indicated otherwise. The manor’s windows have wooden storm shutters that open and close from within, while the window exteriors are protected by artistic-yet-functional iron grillwork designed to deter thieves (treat these iron grills as iron portcullises if someone tries to damage them).</p><aside class=\"right\"><h3>The Storm</h3><p>As the feast progresses, periodically mention the sight and sound of rain falling outside, rumbles of thunder, and the occasional flash of distant lightning. This storm is meant to add a slightly ominous bit of atmosphere to the prologue, and to encourage the PCs to be eager to spend the night in the manor. You can use the storm as you see fit to push the PCs away from spending the night outside, but if no player seems interested in avoiding a night in the manor, the storm can remain a minor bit of background as this chapter plays out.</p></aside><h2>The Great Hall</h2><p>When you’re ready to begin play, the PCs are gathered between the oaks on the walkway leading to the manor’s front door, awaiting their turn to be led into the Great Hall. Others who have answered Lady Jamandi’s call for heroes also wait, but at this time, the focus should be on the PCs, who are last in line to be admitted. The sky above is gloomy, and distant thunder suggests a storm is imminent. Have each player introduce and describe their character; whether or not they know each other is up to the players. Once the PCs have made their introductions, one of Lady Jamandi’s servants calls for them to enter the manor—they are the final adventurers to be led into the building. As they enter, the first raindrops of the storm begin to fall.</p><p>Read or paraphrase the following as the PCs are led into the Great Hall.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>This spacious hall has been prepared for a great feast. Servants hustle and bustle about, while several armed soldiers—Lady Jamandi’s house guards—watch over the hall from their positions against the east and west walls. To the north, a fire crackles away in a large fireplace. An iron lever secured by a lock adorns the fireplace’s eastern face. Two massive crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling twenty feet above. The walls are decorated with painted murals of idyllic woodland scenes: nymphs frolicking amid waterfalls, satyrs dancing with fawns in wooded glades, and various winged fairy creatures flitting through the trees. Nine long tables are arranged around the central portion of the room, each holding plates, utensils, mugs, goblets, and full, ready-to-be-poured pitchers of ale, wine, mead, and water. The smell of roasted meat and other delicious scents fill the room, yet no food has yet been served.</p></section><p>The lever on the side of the fireplace is locked (@Check[type:thievery|dc:30|traits:action:pick-a-lock] to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H]); Lady Jamandi carries the key. This lever is one of several that controls a security feature that she is quick to use when the manor is attacked. When the lever is thrown, several reinforced iron portcullises drop down at the locations indicated on the manor’s east and west wings. Once lowered, these portcullises hinder movement through the ground floor and completely block all access to the upper floors—raising each is a complex process requiring manipulation of additional levers found on the uppermost floor. These portcullises are lowered once the manor comes under attack in @UUID[.ItjhjkZDsp6r8qjJ] of this chapter, and they will likely remain closed long enough to (hopefully) allow the PCs to defeat the Black Tears before the villains can do too much damage.</p><p>Once the PCs step into the Great Hall, they’re each escorted to the same table. As chance would have it, several other potential adventurers have been seated here as well. Feel free to give your players some time to talk among themselves after they’re seated, but you should hold back on conversations with the NPCs who share their table for now. Aside from a few sneering looks of obvious disapproval from @UUID[.vUpVTeUCLoI4eDBG] and perhaps a few coarse comments from @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR.JournalEntryPage.ENpFabRUClqX28ql] (“Where is this Lady Whoever?” or “Who are these Aldori, anyway?”), the PCs and other adventurers should have very little time to engage one another in conversation before a bell announces @UUID[.IxpecTa4ziGB8tcd].</p>"

It’s left to the GM to determine if the PCs anger her to the point that she has them arrested.

With or without the PCs’ assistance, this takes the rest of the night and the better part of the morning.</p><section class=\"treasure\"><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.qeQyNOaaaQBSCrQq]</strong>: Unless the PCs have already looted her treasury (area @UUID[.BRnf8a2xm9yRy0zt]), Lady Jamandi offers each PC a reward of 50 gp and two lesser healing potions for their valorous deeds the night before. She also allows the PCs to keep as much bandit treasure and gear as they can carry, though she hints that she will put any looted gear they leave behind to good use.</p></section><p>A few hours after dawn the next day, the situation at the manor is more or less under control. Engineers from Restov have arrived and are busy surveying the fire-damaged parts of the manor to plan repairs, while the dead have been gathered and are being prepared for funeral services. Servants are busy throughout the manor and grounds, making minor repairs, cleaning up bloodstains, or recovering from the ordeal.</p><h2>The Heroes Gather</h2><p>Lady Jamandi gathers the PCs and the other surviving adventurers (Amiri, Harrim, Linzi, Tartuccio, Valerie, and—if she didn’t leave the prior evening—Jaethal) in the Great Hall at noon. As the PCs enter, they’ll have a chance to see even more adventurers and explorers who have been contacted by Lady Jamandi. At this point, you can simply read or paraphrase the following text to the PCs if you wish to begin the adventure into the Stolen Lands, or you can use the following information to roleplay the scene how you see fit. There should be no significant encounters or challenges for the PCs to face at this point—the goal here is to introduce them to their future neighbors (and in some cases, competitors) in the Stolen Lands and present them their initial charter.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>It’s shocking how quickly Lady Jamandi’s staff have restored the manor’s Great Hall in the space of a few morning hours. Very few signs of the violence of the night before remain, and things have been mostly returned to normal. As the adventurers who survived the assault take seats at the tables, other adventurers who arrived just today settle in as well. Even with these newcomers, though, there are far fewer heroes in the hall than there were the previous evening, and the atmosphere is serious and somber as Lady Jamandi steps up to speak.</p><p>“I would like to thank those of you who helped defeat the Black Tears last night,” Lady Jamandi begins. “It’s obvious someone doesn’t like our plans to settle the Stolen Lands. Well, we’re not so easily dissuaded, are we? I say no, and this morning, I would like to issue formal charters to all of you to begin exploring the Stolen Lands and make them safe for tomorrow’s settlers.</p><p>“The first charter we would like to bequeath goes to the group called the Iron Wraiths,” she states, with a wave towards a band of four well-armored adventurers. “The tales of your adventures have thrilled many Brevic nobles, and I’m excited to see what you can do with the exploration of the Glenebon Uplands. Your charter is to establish a base for Brevoy there after dealing with the Tiger Lords and then to open diplomatic relations with Pitax from a point of strength.”</p></section><p>The Iron Wraiths make their way up to Lady Jamandi and she gives them their charters. As they leave the room, make them seem arrogant but also experienced and confident, so when the PCs learn of @UUID[JournalEntry.hg9Bztz48jKxb8K6.JournalEntryPage.eWE70RNtoCjzgbVg] later in the campaign, they should be shocked and a bit terrified. As the Wraiths leave the hall, some might even make catcalls at the remaining adventurers (including the PCs) as they leave. “Hey, ‘heroes,’ don’t forget to bring your stuffed animals so you don’t get scared.” or “I bet 30 gold these other ‘adventurers’ won’t last a fortnight.” Lady Jamandi shakes her head in frustration and disapproval at these antics then proceeds with the second charter.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>“Baron Hannis Drelev, as per our previous discussions, your charter is one of specific importance for Brevoy. Securing the southern trade routes along the East Sellen River and establishing a base for merchant caravans and barges alike is of utmost importance! Hooktongue Slough will be your base of operations.”</p></section><p>A @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.ADMctdyXAlSmymUG] takes his charter from Lady Jamandi with a crisp bow that’s barely more than a nod, then walks from the room. The PCs notice a slight sneer on his face as he makes his exit with nary a word nor look toward anyone else. Once he’s on his way, Lady Jamandi turns to one of the PCs’ table mates from the previous evening.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>Maegar Varn, your father Androth has long been a faithful friend. Your charter assigns you to Nomen Heights to establish a town with the Varnling Host. In time, we hope to establish an Aldori dueling school there, but in the more immediate future, we ask you to broker an alliance with the Nomen centaurs who roam the region. I trust you and your fellows are up to the task!”</p></section><p>Maegar Varn walks up to accept his charter from Lady Jamandi. As he leaves the Great Hall, he passes by the PCs’ table and smiles at them. “Once you get established, I would love to have you come visit so we can set up trade relations. Good luck!” With a swish of his cape, he turns and leaves. Unless the PCs take the time to visit @UUID[JournalEntry.O3T2uvkYQD6kZOEQ.JournalEntryPage.BAy0CntI5Ct395FN] before it meets its doom in @UUID[JournalEntry.O3T2uvkYQD6kZOEQ.JournalEntryPage.AQqzMyG06BXlZPnY], it’s unlikely they’ll ever see Maegar again. Once he’s gone, only the PCs and a few others who managed to survive the night remain in the hall.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>“And last, but certainly not least, last night’s heroes. First, I want to thank you again for risking your lives to help defend my manor. The courage, gumption, and skill you displayed will take you far, I suspect! For your charters, we’re asking you to travel to the southwest into the region known as the Greenbelt, a swath of wildlands that includes the forest known as the Narlmarches and the hill country of the Kamelands. We’ve heard that the bandits have grown particularly aggressive in the Greenbelt, and they need to be stopped before anyone safely settles in the region. A small trading post in the Rostland hinterlands has been particularly hard hit—I suggest starting there. Once the bandits have been dealt with, we will be ready to bequeath to you more permanent charters to settle the land and establish a government of your own!”</p></section><p>Lady Jamandi hands each of the remaining adventurers copies of the same charter, @UUID[JournalEntry.1S5XVzEgRf2MKa6U.JournalEntryPage.DAvrji0UyCRczQmH]. (The date provided in the handout is arbitrary—you can adjust the date that this campaign begins to whatever you prefer in your game.) In any event, Lady Jamandi is eager to get back to the task of tending to her employees and family and repairing damage to her manor; she encourages the PCs to leave for @UUID[JournalEntry.AgbaF8i9XDLEtxqe.JournalEntryPage.fTB6r42OJIsE5Y3e] at once and wishes them luck on their adventures.</p><section class=\"spotlight\"><article class=\"flexfill\"><h2>Heading West</h2><p>Once the PCs have their charter and have accepted any potential companion NPCs into their ranks, the time to head out and begin the exploration of the Stolen Lands is nigh!

Her “call for heroes” promises a great and perilous opportunity to claim an equally heroic reward.

So, I think the rooms further west are still safe. Getting to them is risky, but certainly possible.”</p><p><strong>Who are the attackers?</strong> “Judging from their tattoos, I think they’re members of the Black Tears, an organized gang of killers who usually operate in northern Brevoy. I’m surprised they’ve made such a brazen move—either they’re desperate, or someone paid them well enough to attempt this attack.”</p><p><strong>Where is Lady Jamandi?</strong> “She ordered me to hold the Great Hall, then took a squad of eight guards with her and went to clear out the West Wing. Her goal was to retake the @UUID[.Aq2xnKZFrO1ErKNL] at the far end of the manor, so I’ll wager you’ll find her there.”</p><p><strong>Will you raise the portcullises?</strong> “Even if I could, I wouldn’t. They’re meant to limit the movement of invaders, and the levers to raise them are located upstairs. They’ll stay lowered until we retake the manor.”</p><p><strong>Where is Lord Mayor Sellemius?</strong> “He left hours ago, shortly after the feast concluded. His carriage probably took him to his villa in Restov. I hope he wasn’t waylaid by these criminals on his way home!”</p><p><strong>What are your plans?</strong> “I intend to hold this hall until Lady Jamandi returns.”</p><p><strong>Are the manor grounds safe? Can we leave the manor?</strong> “I’d advise against it. I’ve heard reports that roving bands of these attackers still hold the manor grounds. I won’t have enough guards to secure them until Lady Jamandi returns.”</p></section><p>Ivenzi is desperate for help of any kind, and after answering the PCs’ questions, he asks them to make their way through the West Wing and help Lady Jamandi defeat the remaining attackers. If the PCs balk or outright refuse, he reminds them that Lady Jamandi can be a significant ally. The attack on the manor is a clear threat to the PCs as well, and it would be in their best interest to help Lady Jamandi retake her home.

Tartuccio’s plan is to recruit a clan of kobolds he’s had contact with before, the @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U], as his minions. Using a ritual to change his appearance into a strange, purple-scaled kobold, he swiftly infiltrates and takes over the Sootscales within days of receiving his charter.

Yet other empires existed in these times as well—empires ruled not by humans but by creatures of legend. The cyclopes ruled two such empires, notably one in Garund and another in northwestern Casmaron. As with their contemporaries, time brought an end to their rule.</p><p>Yet while the cyclops empires crumbled, they have not vanished from Golarion altogether. Pockets of them exist today, although they possess but a shadow of their former glory. Only in remote locations does evidence of ancient cyclops empires still exist. One such remnant lies deep in the @UUID[JournalEntry.lMIawppop9uCHRXq.JournalEntryPage.yiEXtaHZrnML6v0K] in the form of the cyclops lich @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK], once a notorious tyrant and powerful necromancer in Casmaron long ago. Vordakai himself did not survive the uprising and turmoil that followed Earthfall during the Age of Darkness, yet ironically his name did. The least of his apprentices appropriated his master’s name in the hope of using its power to rebuild an empire. Yet in the end, this task would require more than notoriety. This new Vordakai became the last when those he was attempting to command rose up against him and, in an ironic turn of events, trapped him in a tomb of his own design, hidden away at the westernmost edge of Casmaron in a minor mountain range often overlooked by explorers and adventurers.</p><p>As the ages wore on and Vordakai’s torpor changed into an ageless slumber, his name lived on in the legends of the region’s Nomen centaurs, who took up a tradition of standing vigil over the approach to his tomb, ready to act upon any sign of his return. But when Taldor’s militaristic expansion into the Stolen Lands drove the Nomen centaurs east into Iobaria, the approach to Vordakai’s tomb was left unguarded. When Nomen refugees returned generations later after Taldor abandoned the Stolen Lands, the tales of Vordakai had largely been forgotten.</p><p>This status quo has remained over the intervening years—until now, that is. When the swordlords of Restov sent agents south into the Stolen Lands, a new colony—Varnhold—was established at the edge of the old centaur rangelands, and along with these settlers came an ambitious treasure hunter named @UUID[Actor.Tru8p4BbBoIS0hbX]. Using Varnhold as a base of operations and following an ancient map copied from an even more ancient tablet recovered from deep Casmaron, Willas hoped to find a previously undiscovered hoard of treasure. Unfortunately for Willas, he mistranslated the ancient tablet, and what he had assumed was an indication of vast magical wealth was actually a warning of vast magical danger.</p><p>Armed with his mistranslated lore, Willas ranged far and wide while Varnhold was being established, operating under the guise of a scout determining the lay of the land and identifying any potential threats facing the fledgling settlement. It was on one of these journeys that he discovered @UUID[JournalEntry.OcO78IbhsDP8cUof.JournalEntryPage.RzHbxYswWo3145mp] and crossed the deep waters of the Little Sellen on a swan boat feather token. On the island, he located wards designed to prevent intrusion and grasped something of their dire nature. He was about to turn back when he glimpsed a cache of treasure just a short way down the corridor leading into the tomb. Greed overcame his common sense, and he crept inside to investigate—but as he did, he felt the ancient warding alarms go off. Pausing only to snatch a single jade bracelet, Willas fled the tomb and retreated back across the river.</p><p>Willas knew he’d triggered the guardian wards but managed to creep back out of the ruined complex without triggering any others. He then returned to Varnhold with the bracelet. Along the way, he worked up a story about how he found the jade bracelet on the shore of a riverbank, hoping to cover up his momentary lack of judgment. Unfortunately, Willas’s fears were well founded, for the triggering of the wards woke Vordakai from his ageless slumber, and in so doing, the treasure hunter had doomed Varnhold.</p>"

Believing the “bracelet” to be an artifact of that culture, he sent word to an old colleague from Oppara—@UUID[Actor.GvcutIrf9nMbjyHv], a scholar specializing in Iobarian antiquities. Maestro Pendrod is also a composer, and as he was in the beginning stages of composing an epic opera dedicated to the history of the Iobarian steppes, he gleefully accepted word of the artifact as evidence of a link between Nomen centaurs and those of ancient Iobaria. He set out for Varnhold to study this magnificent find.</p><p>Yet Maestro Pendrod was not the only individual interested in the “bracelet,” for with its theft, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK] awoke. Using his powers to recover the ring and discover the location of the thief, the lich located both in Varnhold.

A sign above the door depicts a rider clinging to the back of a madly galloping horse with a green mane and a fish’s tail extending from its hindquarters. The inn’s walls are painted a cheerful shade of yellow to complement the red shutters.</p></section><figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/journal-kingdom/waterhorse-sign.webp\" width=\"250\" /><figcaption>The Waterhorse</figcaption></figure><p>The Waterhorse was the center of social interaction in Varnhold on days other than Sundays (when the focus shifted to the church). The hostler, Miriam Kolescu, was of old Issian stock from a fishing village on the shore of the Lake of Mists and Veils. She brought many of her family’s traditions and beliefs with her to Varnhold, though she was also a staunch loyalist to the Surtova crown. Her inn is simple but well kept. Its first floor consists of a common room (whose tables are set with rotting plates of food), a kitchen, a bathing chamber, and stores, along with a wing for the Kolescu family. The second floor consists of six guest rooms, all of which save one were unoccupied at the time the population vanished.</p><p>The inn’s most recent patron was also its most famous. @UUID[Actor.GvcutIrf9nMbjyHv] had been staying at the inn for about a week before the vanishing. Maestro Pendrod hailed from Oppara’s Kitharodian Academy. His studies into the indigenous peoples of ancient Iobaria brought him to Varnhold when @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR.JournalEntryPage.4E0PyKqqYxZhDWcE], a former student of his, sent word of @UUID[Actor.Tru8p4BbBoIS0hbX]’s unusual find.</p><p>The first thing PCs notice upon approaching the front door of the inn is a single word hastily scratched into the wood of the front door in Common: “NOMEN.” When the beckon of @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK] summoned Maestro Pendrod along with the rest of the village, he finally realized the true source of the jade “bracelet” and used his last ounce of willpower to scratch this word with his dagger. He did so not as a warning, but in the hopes that those who came to investigate the vanishing would seek out the centaurs for more information about the cause of the event.</p><section class=\"treasure\"><p>@UUID[Actor.8CxxlcQSh06MAfXo] The inn’s till holds 1 gp, 37 sp, and 52 cp.</p></section><h3>Common Room</h3><p>Ervil Pendrod established himself in a comfortable corner of the inn’s common room, where he conducted his research on the “bracelet” and the surrounding region, entertained questions from the colonists, and gave impromptu lectures on his findings. He was in the midst of his research when Vordakai came, and the notes he left behind (see Treasure below) intrigued a spriggan who wandered into the tavern the day the Culcheks came to town. Unfortunately for the spriggan, they triggered a defensive ward Pendrod had placed on his collection; the spriggan’s body lies dead on the ground, their arms, chest and face battered and shattered. A PC who succeeds at a DC 23 check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.eReSHVEPCsdkSL4G] while investigating the notes and the body confirms that the spriggan was likely slain by a heightened sound burst stored in the notes via a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.o0l57UfBm9ScEUMW].</p><p>Maestro Pendrod’s research materials remain on the table in the corner, somewhat scattered by the spriggan’s ill-advised attempt to search them, but still readable. They include several books with titles such as Iobarian Prehistory, Centaurs of Central Casmaron, The Untold Cost of the Taldan Armies of Exploration, and the book that once bore Pendrod’s glyph of warding: Secrets of the Rashalka Mounds. Among these works is an incomplete ethnography of the indigenous peoples of the Iobarian steppes—Pendrod was working on a section on the Rashalka centaurs and speculated that a local group known as Nomen is an offshoot of the greater Rashalka population who broke away and relocated to this area in the distant past. Mixed in with the books are a number of charcoal sketches of a heavy jade bracelet bearing peculiar markings that Maestro Pendrod has attributed to the premigration Nomen centaurs.</p><p>At the bottom of the stack sits a letter from Maegar Varn dated 2 months ago and addressed to Maestro Pendrod. This letter describes Willas’s discovery of the jade bracelet on the banks of a “river of local provenance” and requests Pendrod’s presence for further study of the artifact. The “bracelet” itself, however, is nowhere to be found.</p><section class=\"treasure\"><p><strong>Treasure:</strong> Maestro Pendrod’s @UUID[Item.zpB0hbCLGFhy9Kd4] could be sold to a bookdealer for as much as 50 gp, though they might question how the PCs came by books that bear the professor’s own sigil as well as that of the Kitharodian Academy on the inside cover. The academy itself would pay a 75 gp reward for the return of all of Maestro Pendrod’s books and papers.</p></section><h3>Guest Rooms</h3><p>A search of the inn’s guest rooms reveals that only one of them was inhabited at the time of the vanishing. An investigation of the personal effects that remain indicate its occupant was Ervil Pendrod.</p><section class=\"treasure\"><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.bAfyWCvgsYDyw3ff]: Pendrod's finely crafted viola (recognizable as the work of the master craftsman Azores of Wispil), can be found in a case beneath his bed by a PC who succeeds at a @Check[type:perception|dc:20|traits:action:search] check.</p></section><p>Among the more mundane possessions in his travel trunk is a small library of further reference works. These tomes seem to be of less immediate relevance to his current project, but a PC who succeeds at a @Check[type:perception|dc:25|traits:action:search] check locates a centuries-old geography book by one Carmyn e’Brothasa, chronicler of Taldor’s Third Army of Exploration into the north. One passage is marked by Maestro Pendrod and reproduced as @UUID[JournalEntry.1S5XVzEgRf2MKa6U.JournalEntryPage.gEza1vHd4Z3Aq3vl]. Pendrod’s own handwriting in the margin of the text contains a simple but strange note: “@UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK]—sounds familiar—wish I had my full library to research...” The book frustratingly doesn’t provide a location for the mythical island mentioned in the text, nor does it provide any further clues to Pendrod’s cryptic margin note. The name “Vordakai” is a difficult one to recognize, but a successful @Check[type:arcana|dc:25|traits:action:recall-knowledge], @Check[type:occultism|dc:25|traits:action:recall-knowledge], or @Check[type:society|dc:25|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check or a @Check[type:iobara-lore|dc:20|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo] allows a PC to recall it as the name of an ancient Iobarian necromancer. A critical success recalls also that Vordakai was a cyclops from an empire that predated Earthfall.</p><p>Anyone who speaks Sylvan recognizes that “Olah-Kakanket” translates into Common as “Valley of the Dead,” and a successful @Check[type:survival|dc:33|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check or @Check[type:hills-lore|dc:33|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge is enough to remember that a location bearing this name lies somewhere to the south in the foothills of the Tors of Levenies; it’s unlikely that the PCs will be able to achieve this success, though—they are more likely to learn this from the Nomen centaurs in @UUID[.8EmhsBJ0xEjZeQqv].</p>"

She denies any involvement beyond this with the vanishing, and in truth, the mystery disturbs her, as she fears that what happened to the human town could happen to her people next. She presents the PCs with an opportunity to prove their worth: she asks them to seek out the Culchek spriggans and return with an important magical bow the monsters stole from her people several years ago. Aecora can give the PCs directions to the Culcheck cavern (area @UUID[JournalEntry.lMIawppop9uCHRXq.JournalEntryPage.GIwu0CRXdB8hXGbC]); she is unaware that the spriggans have moved into Varnhold unless the PCs tell her.</p><p><strong>Aecora Becomes Helpful</strong>: Aecora reveals the information for becoming friendly, but as she does, her voice softens and she even grows somewhat apologetic. She explains that her people have a violent history with humans, going back to Taldor’s Army of Exploration, and she offers to let the PCs stay the night in the camp to recover and rest as a show of her goodwill.</p><section class=\"milestone\"><p><strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs make Aecora friendly or helpful, grant them 80 XP.</p></section><h3>Aecora’s Story</h3><p>If she’s made friendly or helpful, Aecora shares more information with the PCs. If the PCs haven’t mentioned @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK], she does so now, revealing that the Nomen centaurs believe Vordakai to be a “slumbering warlord—an ancient, powerful figure from the distant past.” Aecora apologizes for being unable to give the PCs more information, as her people have lost much of their history in the years since they were dispersed by Taldor’s armies.</p><p>At this point, Aecora tells the PCs of a place to the west called Olah-Kakanket—the Valley of the Dead. This place is taboo to the Nomen centaurs, but their traditions also dictate that they must watch the valley for signs of disturbance or strange awakenings. Recently, a Nomen hunter saw a frightful shape lumbering amid the stones of Olah-Kakanket. Aecora wonders if, perhaps, the humans of Varnhold with their insatiable curiosity and drive to expand and conquer might have entered Olah-Kakanket and if this, perhaps, might be tied to the vanishing. One thing she can confirm, though, is that the name “Vordakai” is associated with a narrow trail that leads up into the mountains from the far end of Olah-Kakanket; she believes that the valley is a cemetery and that this trail leads to @UUID[JournalEntry.OcO78IbhsDP8cUof.JournalEntryPage.RzHbxYswWo3145mp].</p><p>If at any time the PCs mention the mysterious bracelet mentioned or sketched in Pendrod’s notes (see area @UUID[.TJrorq2PkgJ9KeX4]), she says that Nomen centaurs wear no such jewelry, only further convincing her that someone from Varnhold disturbed something that should have been left alone in Olah-Kakanket.</p><p>Before the party departs, Aecora makes one final plea. She admits that the centaur who claimed to see a strange shape lumbering deep in Olah-Kakanket was her headstrong daughter @UUID[Actor.iEB0VtXj6b8IZspz]. When Xamanthe confronted Aecora, demanding to learn more about the site, Aecora was unable to satisfy her daughter’s curiosity. Xamanthe has now been missing for several days, and Aecora fears the worst: that her daughter has broken tradition and entered Olah-Kakanket to investigate it on her own. The possibility that her daughter broke this taboo is painful for Aecora to contemplate, but the possibility of the loss of her daughter is more painful. She asks the PCs to remain observant if they enter Olah-Kakanket and to search for clues as to Xamanthe’s whereabouts, if they can.</p><p>Once the meeting with Aecora is over, the centaur politely but firmly asks the PCs to leave their encampment, as their presence makes most of Nomen centaurs uncomfortable and nervous.</p><section class=\"quest\"><header class=\"split\"><h3 class=\"creature-name\">Rescuing Xamanthe</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>30 XP</li></ul></header><article><p>The PCs are tasked with rescuing the centaur Xamanthe from Vordakai’s Tomb.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Aecora Silverfire.</p><p><strong>Completion:</strong> Bring Xamanthe back to the Nomen centaurs, or spin a convincing tale of her fate to Aecora (requiring a critical success at Lying or at Making an Impression).</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> If the mystery of Xamanthe’s disappearance is explained, Aecora thanks the PCs and rewards them with four moderate healing potions and four scrolls of restoration; if the PCs returned Skybolt, she also gives them the bow to honor their service.

Since he was defeated eons ago by kin, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK] has slumbered in his tomb, unmoving while he awaited the call of his otherworldly masters. He rests unaware that a watch has been set by the centaurs of Iobaria—bitter enemies of his people—to prevent intrusion into his tomb and the subsequent awakening that would surely follow. Even in recent years, when the Nomen watch faltered and humans from surrounding lands managed to penetrate the outer precincts of the tomb, its remote location has continued to ensure that none broke the wards that kept him in his torpor. Not until @UUID[Actor.Tru8p4BbBoIS0hbX] came from Varnhold and stole a treasure from the tomb, setting off the tomb’s wards, did Vordakai finally awaken.</p><p>Now, the ancient lich studies a strange new world through the eyes of a recently acquired raven familiar and via interrogations of villagers he snatched from Varnhold. As he reacquaints himself with the world and learns that his people’s time has long passed, Vordakai grows increasingly convinced that he has been reborn into a world that is ripe for his rule.</p><h3>Seeking Vordakai’s Tomb</h3><p>The lich Vordakai remains in his tomb, but he’s far from uninformed about the outside world. In particular, his raven familiar, @UUID[JournalEntry.O3T2uvkYQD6kZOEQ.JournalEntryPage.2dVTnEvppzwJgduR], has been scouring the Nomen Heights while Vordakai uses the @UUID[.p9XzCv54ngfPqWMP] to see the world through the bird’s eyes.

Neither he nor Ubagub react kindly to intruders, each croaking loudly to alert the other. Yet Garuum has learned from his past mistakes—now he moderates his violent impulses. He even knows several words of Common.</p><p>As soon as he sees the PCs (and assuming they don’t immediately attack him or Ubagub), Garuum holds up his hands and croaks out, “Truce! Truce!” Garuum just wants to be left alone, but his limited knowledge of Common (the only words he knows are boggard, bug, slurk, snake, truce, hungry, me, you, die, and go) might make communication difficult. Garuum is quick to interpret attempts to search his “kingdom” or simply to walk through it as offensive acts, and attacks.</p><p>If the PCs establish a line of communication with the boggard, he tells them his story and that he doesn’t want to cause problems; if the PCs leave him be, he’ll reciprocate. In fact, he’s willing to tell the characters what he knows of the nearby woods in return for them leaving him alone.

He made no judgments on those who chose to use his bridge. Be they bandit or trapper, as long as they had the coin, he allowed them to cross the Shrike. As this crossing was the only significant one in the region, Davik made a fair amount of money for his hard work.</p><p>Unfortunately, after he finally made enough to recoup the cost of building the rope bridge, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.70FiR5COVuuS28ZD] rose to power downriver on the north shore of the Tuskwater. When the Stag Lord paid a visit to the crossing, he informed Davik that not only were the men bearing the Stag Lord’s badge to be granted free passage over the bridge, but that Davik would now have to pay the Stag Lord two-thirds of his monthly take in return for “protection.” In his response to the Stag Lord’s demands, Davik made a foolish error. He not only refused the offer, but ran the bandit and his men off with his trusty ranseur and the aid of his three slavering hounds. After the incident, Davik rewarded himself with a meal of fresh fish and went to bed early. Not surprisingly, the Stag Lord did not stay away for long.</p><p>In the dead of night, the bandits returned. They surrounded Davik’s house and set it on fire with flaming arrows. Davik woke in terror to his dogs’ barking, and as he stumbled out of his burning home, ranseur in hand, the bandits attacked. His polearm provided little help as the archers’ flaming arrows rained down, killing his hounds and wounding Davik. With his nightshirt aflame, the doomed bridge keeper tumbled down the path toward the river. After dousing himself with water, he clambered up to the bridge and tried to escape to the north shore.</p><p>The bandits followed, and as Davik passed the midpoint on his bridge, the Stag Lord and his men cut several ropes. The bridge collapsed, plunging the shrieking Davik into the river below. Though he struggled mightily to swim ashore, the current was too much and he drowned. Onshore, the bandits watched, gleefully chuckling, their leering shadows dancing before the hovel’s flames as it burned down to cinders. The Stag Lord returned to his fort, leaving behind several bandits to rebuild the bridge and take up the position of toll taker.</p><p>The next night, as the bandits argued over who would get to be the bridge’s new “boss,” Davik rose from the river as an undead thing of vengeance. He stalked out of the water, weapon in hand, and murdered the brigands before dragging their bodies into the river. The Stag Lord sent more bandits to investigate several days later, and though Davik rose again to kill most of them, three escaped to report back to their leader. The Stag Lord wisely decided to abandon his plans to rebuild the bridge, and in the months since, has all but forgotten about Davik and his tolls.</p><p>Today, Nettle's Crossing is a soggy, abandoned remnant. One thick and sagging rope still hangs across the river, all that remains of the bridge that once spanned it. A signpost at either end of the ruined bridge reads “Nettles’ Crossing—5 coppers—ring bell for service.” A rusty bell hangs by each sign. On the south bank of the river, encroaching vegetation has slowly devoured the crumbled remains of a burned-down wooden building.</p><section class=\"skill\"><p>Crossing the river via the hanging rope is possible with a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:15] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy], but the rope snaps if more than two Medium creatures (two Small creatures count as one Medium creature) attempt to cross at the same time.

The nixie, @UUID[Actor.RTd4FwqGq8gBjdAO], did not take kindly to the loggers despoiling her home and unsuccessfully attempted to scare them off with ample use of @UUID[Actor.RTd4FwqGq8gBjdAO.Item.5kg7JjXt6IFWf6Wf] and @UUID[Actor.RTd4FwqGq8gBjdAO.Item.veuImnnlVr4xjZzt]. When that tactic failed, Melianse took the time to inveigle one of the lumberjacks, and then another, and both now stand guard in front of her pool. Since both are good workers, @UUID[Actor.48o307dry03xazvd] has resisted the urge to fight his own employees, but he is fast losing patience with the nixie and fears the blow to his reputation in his workers’ eyes if he dithers much longer. The two groups are now in a standoff, with neither willing to make the next move.</p><p>When the PCs arrive on the scene, Corax and six of his eight @UUID[Actor.UAlHSl6Cpujld1dx] stand angrily near the felled trees, about 30 feet from the pool. The other two lumberjacks stand at the water’s edge, facing Corax. Melianse floats in the center of the pool with only her head above water; she remains about 20 feet from the shore, out of the loggers’ reach, and silently observes their response.</p><p>As soon as Corax notices the PCs, he sees them as potential allies. He quickly hails them and explains the situation in a gruff voice liberally laced with profanity, claiming that the nixie attacked his workers unprovoked and complaining bitterly about how hard it is for “a decent man to make a living with all these damnable fairies in the woods.” Melianse responds calmly to this accusation, claiming that she politely asked the loggers to leave at first but was forced to enchant two of them after Corax threatened to hang her from the nearest tree “to drip dry.” She adds that the trees felled by the loggers had been growing next to the pool for more than 200 years and deserved a far better fate than serving as “some grubby peasant’s slop table.” Both Corax and Melianse appeal to the PCs for help. The conversation soon devolves into more accusations and shouted insults.</p><p>Unless action is taken by the PCs to defuse the situation, Corax eventually loses patience and orders his six unaffected lumberjacks to subdue their entranced colleagues and attack the nixie. Melianse responds by ordering the inveigled loggers to defend her pool while she targets Corax with her spells. If the PCs ally with Corax, Melianse focuses her magic on them. If the PCs ally with Melianse, Corax orders three loggers to focus on Melianse while he and the other three fight the PCs. Corax surrenders if reduced to 10 or fewer Hit Points, vowing to practice his trade “someplace where the damned fairies don’t run the show!” Melianse fights to the death to defend her home.</p></section><p>If the PCs want to defuse the situation, they must negotiate an accord between the two parties. First, Corax and Melianse, both of whom are quite angry, must be calmed down and convinced to talk. Diplomacy or Intimidation checks might work (both Corax and Melianse are unfriendly to the PCs at the start of the encounter), or spells such as charm or calm emotions can be used (although if they fail, both sides might be spurred to attack the PCs). Once the two agree to negotiate, both must be satisfied with the result. Corax wants his lumber and demands that Melianse release his two workers from her influence. Melianse wants the loggers to leave her glade and provide reparation for the trees they’ve already felled.</p><p>Obviously, there is no single correct answer to appease everyone; reward players who come up with creative solutions as long as both groups get something out of the negotiations. (One possible solution is to provide the loggers with another source of lumber; a PC who succeeds at a @Check[type:nature|dc:18] or Forest Lore check recalls an untouched grove of coachwood trees 10 miles to the north, near the old tatzlwyrm den, that the lumberjacks can freely harvest if shown the way to the grove.) For her part, Melianse releases the two entranced loggers if the group leaves and replaces the three trees they’ve cut down (as detailed in the quest Melianse’s Trees below).</p><section class=\"quest\"><header class=\"split\"><h3 class=\"creature-name\">Melianse’s Trees</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>30 XP</li></ul></header><article><p>The PCs must replace three trees that have been cut down in the prime of their lives.

She simply wants three new trees planted in her glade to help restore her home.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Melianse (area TW1)</p><p><strong>Completion:</strong> The easiest solution to this quest involves gathering three tree feather tokens and placing them near the three felled trees. If the PCs don’t think of this, the nixie can suggest it, recommending they contact the dryad Tiressia to the northwest (area @UUID[.bLxVZCuHjKPssNXv]). Melianse knows the dryad has a few of these feather tokens but suspects Tiressia will want a favor before handing over the tokens (Melianse doesn’t know about @UUID[.bLxVZCuHjKPssNXv] facing the dryad). Alternatively, the PCs could buy three of these feather tokens from a merchant in a city.</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> Not only does Melianse agree to release the two inveigled lumberjacks from her control, she also agrees to teach the PCs the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5pwK2FZX6QwgtfqX] ritual if they wish.

They’ve chosen this site as a good place for their base camp, but while they were setting up their tents, a band of kobolds attacked the group. The gnomes managed to drive the kobolds off, but not before the kobolds caused a lot of damage and panicked two ponies that were still hitched to the gnomes’ supply wagon. The horses rushed into the water, and the wagon swiftly became lodged in the muddy river bed. The gnomes have been unable to get the wagon unstuck and now stand helplessly on the shore, watching as the powerful current threatens to wash the wagon, its cargo, and the ponies downstream.</p></section><p>The expedition is made up of nine gnome explorers under the leadership of the flamboyant Jubilost Narthropple, a wealthy gnome explorer, mapmaker, and raconteur. Narthropple stands atop a small hillock next to the river, his eye blackened, glasses missing and helmet askew from the fight with the kobolds, shouting out conflicting orders and growing more furious (and scared) with each passing round the wagon is in danger. While Jubilost is much too proud to ask the PCs for help, the other gnomes are not, and they call out for aid as soon as they see the PCs, as long as the PCs don’t immediately appear to be bandits or worse.</p><p>If the PCs wish to help the gnomes, they have 6 rounds to act before the wagon is lost. Anyone helping must first @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.c8TGiZ48ygoSPofx] (requiring a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:15|traits:action:swim] check) to the stranded wagon, which is 15 feet offshore. Before it can be moved, the ponies must be unhitched and led to safety. Their harness has Hardness 4 and 16 HP (8 BT); it’s a two-action @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.pvQ5rY2zrtPI614F] activity to unhitch one pony. A PC can then attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe] (@Check[type:nature|dc:18] check) to send one of the distressed ponies to shore (anyone with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.d5BFFHXFJYKs5LXr] ability can instead use Diplomacy to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.DCb62iCBrJXy0Ik6] that the pony move to shore). Once the ponies have been unhitched, a PC can push the wagon 5 feet toward the shore with a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:20|traits:action:shove] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.7blmbDrQFNfdT731] (up to four others can Aid on this check). If the PCs save the wagon and ponies, the gnomes cheer and invite the PCs to have a meal with them.</p><p>Narthropple has drawn up quite a collection of maps of the southern Greenbelt during his quest for encroaching energies and influences from the First World. The maps show the location of every Landmark site in zones 1–5, and they can contain up to five other encounter sites (Standard or Hidden) that you wish to direct the party toward. Jubilost’s maps do not show the location of the Beast’s lair (area @UUID[.89NaJI7jtOsnTr9K]) or the site of the troll lair (area @UUID[.JA4V2iDJug2ZAaRo]).</p><p>Jubilost’s maps could be very useful to the PCs, but the eccentric gnome refuses to part with them unless he is first made helpful through Diplomacy; Jubilost is initially indifferent to the PCs, and making him helpful requires a successful @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:20] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]. He considers his maps important secrets, so it further requires a successful @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:24] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.DCb62iCBrJXy0Ik6] access to them, at which point he agrees to sell his maps for 10 gp per encounter site marked on the maps. If the PCs saved his wagon and ponies, he sells his maps for half that price. Alternately, if the PCs have discovered Hidden sites not on Jubilost’s maps during their explorations, they can trade knowledge of those locations on a one-for-one basis for the locations of sites known to the gnome.</p><section class=\"social\"><p><strong>Companion:</strong> If you’re using the Kingmaker Companion Guide, Jubilost Narthropple could become one of the PCs’ loyal companions; see that book for details on how to incorporate the explorer into your campaign.</p></section><section class=\"treasure\"><p><strong>Treasure:</strong> The expedition’s wagons contain 200 gp worth of miscellaneous supplies and trade goods.

He spends his time muttering to himself or talking to the pet puma he caught and trained years ago, which he calls simply “Cat.” When his cruel urges becomes too strong to ignore, the hateful hermit waylays one of the southern Greenbelt’s infrequent travelers, as he finds that the act of murder calms his nerves for a time.

As the PCs’ nation grows, many of their subjects begin to trade tales about her. Rumors spread that the old woman is a hag, and locals begin calling her the Swamp Witch, claiming (falsely) that she sold her soul to a demon or devil for malign powers. In reality, Elga Verniex isn’t a witch at all, just a bitter old woman who likes her privacy, though her magical powers are legitimate.</p></section><p>Elga doesn’t take kindly to visitors, and to help ensure her privacy, she has animated a pumpkin-headed scarecrow to guard her hut and drive away unwanted guests. Those who regularly come to her for assistance have long since learned to announce their presence before opening her gate.</p><p>The Old Beldame’s hut is a simple, one-room affair; it’s about 20 feet in diameter with a dirt floor and a thatched roof. The rafters are hung with dried herbs and swamp weeds, and a bubbling cauldron (containing nothing more sinister than a weak vegetable broth) hangs over a firepit in the center of the room. The region around the hut is an 80-foot-diameter area of solid ground, thick with bog grass and dotted with small, cattail-clogged pools. This area is surrounded by a waist-high wooden fence, in which a single gate hangs askew. A fist-sized, rusted iron bell hangs from a hairy length of rope tied to a crooked post next to the gate.</p><p>The scarecrow appears to be propped up midway between the gate and the door to the hut—it lurches to life and swiftly moves to attack anyone crossing the line of the fence. The Old Beldame does not emerge from her hut, even if the PCs fight the scarecrow outside. She is somewhat hard of hearing anyway and trusts the scarecrow to take care of any troublesome intruders. She attacks only if the PCs make it past the scarecrow and enter her hut uninvited. She is initially unfriendly to PCs, but she is not evil-hearted, so successful @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:15|traits:action:make-an-impression] checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q] may be able to defuse the situation before it turns violent.</p><p>The Old Beldame is human, although fey blood runs in her veins—over the years, her magical heritage has given her skin a strange greenish cast and lengthened her ears to points, further fuel for the locals’ rumormongering. Should the PCs wish to talk to Elga instead of fighting her, they’d do well to announce themselves by striking the bell on the pole next to the gate before they annoy the scarecrow. The Old Beldame peers out of a window of her hut and angrily demands to know who the PCs are. Initial diplomatic contact must be carried out at this somewhat awkward distance, for if the PCs enter her fenced-in area, she shrieks, ducks into her hut, and lets the scarecrow handle the defense of her domain. If she is made friendly or helpful to the PCs, she invites them into her hut to chat. If she invites the PCs inside, the scarecrow doesn’t attack, though it does turn its head to watch them menacingly as they pass by.</p><p>During an extended conversation with the Old Beldame, the PCs find her to be knowledgeable, though crotchety and ill-tempered.

These two fey have tried to defeat the malevolent plant by themselves, but the tree has repelled their attempts to destroy or expel it. During their last attempt, Falchos suffered grievous injuries before they could flee back to the grove.</p></section><p>Though Tiressia is more powerful than most dryads, she’s still unable to abandon her bonded oak. She has tried rallying the other fey creatures of the area to assist her, but none of them would agree to risk their own lives given what happened to Falchos. Tiressia is desperate to find help, while Falchos wrestles with the choice of abandoning his love or accepting his own inevitable death if he stays to face the scythe tree once it finally locates their home.</p><p>The PCs’ arrival offers a ray of hope, however, and the fey are determined to enlist their aid by any means necessary. Tiressia would prefer not to use magical compulsion to get the PCs’ help, so she acts the part of the damsel in distress, which at this point isn’t much of a stretch. As the PCs approach, Tiressia kneels by the water’s edge and begins weeping softly, her tears falling into the pool to create tiny ripples in the still water.

They’ve already picked off several of Drelev’s explorers and are eager to spring their ambush on anyone trying to navigate the area. These boggards were once members of Sepoko’s cult, but when the boggard cleric fell under the influence of the spirit naga Ngara, he attempted to sacrifice his cultists to prove his worth to his new spiritual obsession. The four boggard cultists who dwell amid these ruins today are all who survived the late-night treachery Sepoko unleashed on the cult. A mix of fear and shame kept the boggard cultists from returning to M’botuu, but today, the four are rather proud of their success here and have no desire to return. These ruins are their home now, and in the months since they’ve settled here, they’ve only grown in power.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><aside class=\"right porthole\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/kingmaker/boggard-cultist.webp\" /></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>@UUID[Actor.LF67gTrSqSb7h4KZ]</h3><p>Moderate 10</p></header><p>Unless the PCs are traveling stealthily, the boggard cultists notice their approach and set up an ambush.

There’s not even a real clearing around the tents, since Ilora can move through the brambles with supernatural ease. These same brambles block the view from the river but allow Ilora to keep an eye on anyone who might be using the waterway to reach her hideout.</p></section><p>Ilora has seen better days, but even those days were fraught with peril. In her previous life, she was the leader of a group of bandits called the River Razors, a merry band of rangers, druids, and rogues who relied upon their shared talents and skills at bushcraft and primal magic to prey upon aristocrats and rich merchants who used the rivers of Pitax to transport their wealth. After @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.UG1YQsZGkWshc4AY] took the crown and banditry increasingly became organized by the Pitax thieves’ guild, Ilora saw her beloved homeland transform into something she hated. Gone were the days when “honest” smugglers and bandits could use Pitax as a safe haven for their work. The rise of drug abuse in the city, the influx of deluded “jesters and fools” eager to please a pompous ruler, and the overwhelming presence of the Pitax wardens turned the city into something she loathed, and her days of banditry turned to rebellion.</p><p>The king and his agents were quick to squash the River Razors, and today, Ilora is the only surviving member. Unable to show her face in Pitax, Ilora continues to build plans to free Pitax from Castruccio and return its rule to the proper families. She’s learned much of the city and knows quite a bit about its defenses, and her reputation as a wanted criminal is likely to come to the PCs’ attention sooner or later.</p><p>If the PCs don’t stumble across her camp on their own during exploration, Ilora eventually learns about them herself. Every few months, she makes the increasingly risky trip downriver to sneak into Pitax under cover of darkness, both to steal supplies she can’t gather in the wild and to listen under open tavern windows to catch up on current events. She hears stories of the PCs’ kingdom and is intrigued from the start, but she doesn’t take action until the @UUID[JournalEntry.yGGSDRma9yTWwdeo] begins. At this point, she casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.yhz9fF69uwRhnHix] to deliver a message to the PCs, inviting them via a short note: “If you wish to discuss how to handle our common enemy, meet me on Hemlock Island at the rise of the next full moon.” (Feel free to replace Hemlock Island with a landmark of your choice.) The exact assistance Ilora can give the PCs to aid their war effort is detailed in @UUID[JournalEntry.yGGSDRma9yTWwdeo.JournalEntryPage.QrjFBXxQxXqklz0L].</p><p>Ilora’s campsite is protected by an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4WAib3GichxLjp5p] spell, which helps her become aware of intruders, but she hasn’t survived this long in the Glenebon Uplands by being aggressive. She knows the monsters and dangers of the region could slay her swiftly, so she works to maintain a low profile on her hunting or foraging trips. By the time the PCs contact her, she has been living on her own in the wild for years. While her personal hygiene and diplomatic abilities have suffered greatly from her isolation, she maintains a strong sense of self and a natural dignity. Ilora doesn’t need society to thrive, but that doesn’t mean she’s fine with allowing Castruccio to continue to ruin the city she still thinks of as home.</p><p>If the PCs manage to encounter her and befriend her before the War of the River Kings begins, Ilora gratefully accepts any offer of asylum in the PCs’ kingdom; when the war begins, she can provide them advice immediately rather than waiting to arrange a meeting on Hemlock Island.</p><p>Ilora only fights foes she’s confident she can handle in battle. Against foes that are obviously more powerful than herself, she has plenty of practice in evasion and does her best to flee. She doesn’t generally hold grudges—Castruccio being a notable exception—but if the PCs continue to vex her, she may be pushed to extremes and seek powerful (but dangerous) alliances with regional threats.</p><section class=\"milestone\"><p><strong>XP Award:</strong> If the PCs manage to secure Ilora’s aid against Pitax, they earn 80 XP.</p></section>"

While an arena or cathedral might stand alone as a towering edifice, most lots represent a number of buildings whose focus is to support the type of improvement that lot supports. For example, a brewery could represent a collection of brewers and bottlers and the families who support them, while a luxury merchant would represent several specialized stores. Even sprawling, sizable improvements like dumps, cemeteries, or parks might include nearby dwellings or cottages for those who tend and manage the area or live along its margins.</p><p><strong>Residential Lots and Overcrowding:</strong> While almost every structure presumably includes a small amount of lodging, you need to build Residential lots in order to give your citizens enough places to live. You do so by building a structure that has the Residential trait in a chosen lot. Settlements require a number of Residential lots equal to the number of blocks that have any structures built within them, although these residential lots need not be located one per block. For example, when a village expands to a town, it initially occupies 2 blocks. It needs 2 Residential lots in total among those 2 blocks, either both in one block or one in each block. A settlement without this minimum number of Residential lots is Overcrowded (mark the “Overcrowded” box on your Urban Grid) and generates 1 Unrest for the kingdom during the @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.WWGNrRZ1dkTjz5Il] of each Kingdom turn.</p><p><strong>Reduced to Rubble:</strong> It’s possible for structures in a settlement to be reduced to rubble by a failed attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.rw2BHBpLyh5Xvqw5] a structure or a poor result from a kingdom event. When a structure is reduced to rubble, replace the lots the structure once occupied on @UUID[.y7f0lbubZNDW5Zhj] with rubble. Having rubble in a lot doesn’t itself impact a kingdom’s Unrest or other statistics negatively, but it does prevent you from building in those lots. You must Demolish that lot before you can build there again. When a single lot that contains part of a multi-lot structure is reduced to rubble, each of the lots that contained that structure are replaced with individual lots of rubble.</p><h2>Structure Descriptions</h2><p>Structures are described in the following format.</p><header class=\"split underlined\"><h3>STRUCTURE NAME</h3><h3>Level</h3></header><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Trait 1</li><li>Trait 2</li></ul><p>A structure’s level indicates the minimum kingdom level required to build it. Each structure has traits that convey its properties. The <strong>Building</strong> trait indicates the structure is a collection of indoor sites, while the <strong>Yard</strong> trait indicates the structure is primarily an outdoor site. <strong>Infrastructure</strong> indicates that the structure benefits all lots in an Urban Grid without occupying a lot. (For a metropolis, this means you’ll need to build Infrastructure separately for each Urban Grid that makes up the settlement.) The <strong>Edifice</strong> trait grants its benefits to a settlement only once; if you build that structure an additional time in the same settlement, it’s purely cosmetic. A <strong>Residential</strong> structure helps house the settlement’s citizens; a settlement requires at least one Residential lot per block to avoid being Overcrowded. The <strong>Famous</strong> trait increases your Fame score when the structure is built, while the <strong>Infamous</strong> trait does the same for your Infamy score. Some structures have both Famous and Infamous traits; in this case apply the one that matches your kingdom’s preference (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.mriZ3uO2ggsPpA2y]). A short textual description rounds out the top of the structure stat block.</p><p><strong>Lots:</strong> The number of contiguous lots that the structure occupies on the Urban Grid; <strong>Cost:</strong> The cost in RP and Commodities (if any) you must spend before attempting the Build Structure check.</p><p><strong>Construction:</strong> This entry lists the required skill, proficiency rank, and DC for the Build Structure check.</p><p><strong>Upgrade From/Upgrade To:</strong> Some structures can be upgraded into a more advanced form of the existing structure, such as upgrading a Shrine into a Temple. If you upgrade a structure, subtract the RP and Commodity cost used to build the original structure from the cost of the new structure. When the new structure is complete, its effects replace those of the previous structure. You can’t upgrade a structure to one that occupies more lots if there isn’t space in the block for the new structure’s size. (You do not need to build the lesser form of a structure before you build the advanced form.)</p><p><strong>Item Bonus:</strong> This entry indicates any item bonuses the structure grants to specific activities made within the settlement’s influence—or within the borders of your kingdom if the settlement is your capital. These bonuses are item bonuses, but they stack with those granted by identical structures within the same settlement, up to that settlement’s maximum item bonus (@UUID[.tqqHYzVPfsyDsoiC]).</p><p><strong>Ruin:</strong> Some structures negatively impact society. If this structure does so, it will increase one or more of your kingdom’s Ruins when constructed; this increase only happens once, when the structure is built.

The grid divides a settlement into 9 large districts (blocks) arranged in a 3-by-3 square. Each district itself comprises 4 individual neighborhoods (lots) arranged in a 2-by-2 square. It is these neighborhood lots in which you’ll build structures to improve your settlement.</p><p>While the Urban Grid diagrams your settlement as a square, this is simply an organizational abstraction—it doesn’t mean that your settlements are literally square. If it helps your sense of verisimilitude, feel free to cut up the Urban Grid and arrange blocks of four lots in any shape you wish. For a city hugging the shores of a great bay, you could draw out the bay and simply paste the blocks in a long row lining the coastline, or in any other arrangement that suits your taste.</p><p>Though the Urban Grid depicts 9 blocks for each settlement, the number of blocks in which you can build is limited by the settlement’s category: a village consists of only a single block (and can thus host a maximum of only 4 lots of structures), while a city can expand to all 9 blocks (and can host up to 36 lots of structures). It’s even possible for your settlement to become a metropolis, expanding to more than one Urban Grid! (See @UUID[.tqqHYzVPfsyDsoiC] for complete details of settlement categories.)</p><h3>Urban Grid Borders</h3><p>The four sides of the Urban Grid are where you record the types of borders your settlement has.</p><p><strong>Land Borders</strong>: By default, all of your settlement’s borders are unremarkable transitions from urban to hinterland—these are known as Land Borders.</p><p>You take a cumulative –1 item penalty on Trade checks for each settlement in your kingdom that has no Land Borders, unless it has at least one Water Border with a Bridge.</p><p><strong>Water Borders</strong>: When you place a settlement in a hex that has lake, river, or swamp terrain, you can locate it so that it has Water Borders. Water Borders provide natural defenses to your settlement during Warfare, and some structures can only be constructed in lots adjacent to Water Borders. However, crossing Water Borders that lack Bridges takes a long time (see Navigating an Urban Grid below).</p><p>If a settlement has only Water Borders, it is on an island; until you build at least one Bridge, that settlement’s @UUID[.tqqHYzVPfsyDsoiC] is 0.</p><p><strong>Walled Borders</strong>: Building Walls on your borders boosts your settlement’s defense in certain events and in Warfare.</p><h3>Navigating an Urban Grid</h3><p>You can simulate travel in a settlement using the Urban Grid to approximate distances. Since moving through a settlement requires a character to follow twisting roads, navigate crowds, or endure minor distractions along the way, it takes 15 minutes to move from one lot to an adjacent lot, or to cross a border (including exiting the settlement). If the settlement has Paved Streets, this travel time is reduced to 5 minutes. Crossing a Water Border that doesn’t have a Bridge takes an hour.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>Water borders in the Strategy Maps</p></header><section class=\"spotlight\"><article class=\"flex50\"><p>With the 57 maps included in this module, and the flexibility offered by rotation, it is possible to represent any configuration of water and land borders.</p><p>If you need to quickly tell how many water borders a given map has, take a look at the key at the end of its name- the number refers to how many water borders it has.

When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.NpVIqD3LgI0Kb9RA] in a lot, you must select a lot in that block.</p><p><strong>Town</strong>: Once your kingdom is 3rd level and you’ve filled all four lots in your village, as long as your settlement is not @UUID[.IVR7vGeMPHkp5KoE], the next time you Build a Structure in a lot, you may choose a lot in any block adjacent to your current block. As you do so, your village becomes a town. A town consists of 2 to 4 blocks of 4 lots each. The blocks must be contiguous, but they need not be a square—they could form a T, L, or S shape if you like. When your kingdom gains its first town, gain 60 kingdom XP as a milestone award.</p><p><strong>City</strong>: Once your kingdom is 9th level and you’ve filled in at least two lots in each of your town’s 4 blocks, if your settlement is not Overcrowded, you may choose a lot anywhere on the Urban Grid when you Build a Structure in a lot. The first time you do so, the town transitions into a city. When your kingdom gains its first city, gain 80 kingdom XP as a milestone award.</p><p><strong>Metropolis</strong>: When your kingdom reaches 15th level and you have filled at least two lots on each block in your city, if your settlement is not Overcrowded, you may expand into a metropolis by adding a second Urban Grid. (You may instead continue filling in the remaining lots and remain a city.) At this point, you can place new structures into any lot you wish in the newly added Urban Grid. You can add additional Urban Grids each time you have built at least two lots of structures in every available block and are not Overcrowded, but there are no further settlement types beyond metropolis to achieve. When your kingdom gains its first metropolis, gain 120 kingdom XP as a milestone award.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>This indicates the maximum number of blocks the settlement can occupy in an Urban Grid.</p><h3>Population</h3><p>A settlement’s exact population is intentionally left abstract, but if you wish to estimate the numbers, you can use the values here as guidelines. Population density increases as a Settlement grows. In a village, each completed lot has an average population of 100 people or less. A town’s average population increases to 125 people per completed lot, whereas a city’s average population per lot increases to around 700. A metropolis can have an average population per completed lot of 1,000 people or more.</p><h3>Level</h3><p>The settlement’s level generally falls within the range listed here, and is always equal to the number of blocks that have at least one structure (to a maximum of 20). A settlement level is separate from the kingdom level and is primarily used to determine potential jobs in the settlement (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 504). A settlement’s level also suggests what sort of magic items might be commonly available for purchase at shops or the market (subject to GM adjudication).</p><p>In the Pathfinder RPG, a settlement’s level is used primarily to determine potential jobs on offer for the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QyzlsLrqM0EEwd7j] activity, and to determine what level of items are commonly available for sale in that community. For the purposes of Kingmaker, it’s easiest to assume that a settlement created by the PCs using these rules has a settlement level equal to the number of blocks on the settlement’s Urban Grid that are completely filled, but you should feel free to adjust these levels as makes sense for their campaign. The levels assigned to NPC settlements in this book (such as Restov, Varnhold, and Pitax) have been set as appropriate for the storyline and are not determined by the number of full city blocks.</p><h3>Consumption</h3><p>Consumption is a numerical value that indicates the Food commodities the settlement requires in order to remain viable and functional. The number given here shows the settlement’s base consumption; specific structures in the settlements can increase or decrease its Consumption.</p><h3>Maximum Item Bonus</h3><p>Many structures within a settlement grant an item bonus to specific kingdom activities. Normally, item bonuses do not stack, but if you build multiple structures of the same type in the same settlement, their item bonuses stack up to this limit. In a case where two settlements have overlapping influences from identical structures, only the higher item bonus from a single settlement’s structures applies.</p><h3>Influence</h3><p>A settlement’s influence area is the area around a settlement where meaningful economic and productive activity can occur, as well as where the settlement’s beneficial effects extend. The numeric value indicates the number of hexes that the settlement’s influence extends. Thus, a village only influences the hex it’s located in, while a town influences all adjacent hexes. If a settlement has only Water Borders and no Bridges, that settlement’s influence is 0 regardless of its settlement type.</p><p>Certain activities and the impact of some kingdom events are limited to a settlement’s influence. Structures in a settlement that provide a specific item bonus do so to all of the claimed hexes influenced by their settlement. (Structures in your capital city provide that bonus to all of the kingdom’s claimed hexes, regardless of the capital’s influence.)</p><p>Hexes not claimed by your kingdom are never part of your settlements’ influence areas, even if they are within the distance noted above. A hex can be influenced by multiple settlements.</p>"

You'll notice that if you double-click on one of the tokens, you'll just get an error message, instead of seeing a character sheet. If you'd like to use these scenes as the basis of one of your own, you can just delete and replace those tokens with real ones.</em></p><section class=\"spotlight\"><article><h2>The Structures Browser</h2><p>This module includes a full set of enhanced assets that can be used to depict every type of structure that is described in the following pages. These can be easily navigated and sorted through using a tool called the <strong>@UUID[Macro.pRoIP31HeNZUcTxu].</strong></p><p>You can access the <strong>Structures Browser</strong> by running the above macro- it's also visible to your players, though you'll need to give them the Create Actors permission (see below) to let them make full use of it.</p></article><figure class=\"right flex50\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/journal-kingdom/tutorial-settlement-browser.webp\" /><h3>The Structures Browser</h3></figure></section><p>The Structures Browser presents a gallery of buildings, with the option of filtering by size (in lots), sorting alphabetically or by level, and toggling between the original artwork and the new enhanced artwork that was made for this module. Selecting a building populates further information in the right hand panel, including a brief description and a link to the structure's associated journal entry. In some cases, such as the Waterfront, there are even multiple pieces of artwork for a given structure- in that case you can cycle through the options by clicking on the arrow buttons beneath the showcase image.</p><p>When you click on the \"Create Structure\" button, the Structures Browser will create a new merchant actor in your world using the currently selected artwork. The application will also set the name, token settings, and so on appropriately. When you're ready to use it, you can place it on your scene just as you would any other token.</p><h3>Customising Buildings</h3><p>Each building is linked to its own specific actor, so you can customise them individually to add some extra flavour to your settlement- for example, renaming a newly created \"Inn\" to \"The Downy Alpaca\", or a newly created Luxury Store to \"Belter &amp; Hoggs\".</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>Setting Permissions</p><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/users/\">Knowledge Base: Users and Permissions</a></p></header><p>If you want your players to be able to create their own buildings, you'll need to grant them the permissions to create new actors and drag tokens for those actors to the canvas. Navigate to the Game Settings tab of the sidebar, click on Configure Settings, and then click the Configure Permissions button located near the top of the window. You'll want to grant the permissions \"Create New Actors\" and \"Create New Tokens\". You may wish to check the box for \"Configure Token Settings\" as well.</p><header><p>FAQ: Why use tokens and not tiles?</p></header><p>Using merchant actors instead of tiles to display this artwork has a lot of benefits- it allows them to have a nameplate, and gives you a quick way to populate them with items if you'd like to turn them into a functional shop. However, the main benefit is that, unlike tiles, players can create, place, move, rotate, and generally customise placed tokens, which can help to give them a much greater feeling of control over the exact appearance and layout of their settlement.</p></section><h2>Decorating a Settlement Scene</h2><p>In addition to the assets for buildings, the Kingmaker module also includes a selection of decorative <strong>Settlement Tiles</strong> that can be used to add roads, bridges, trees and more to your settlements. You can easily find these assets by selecting the Tile Controls in the left-hand toolbar and using the @UUID[Macro.cc5mT4qK9ldh2tT5] macro. Do note that because these are tiles and not tokens, the GM will need to be the one to create and position these tiles.</p><p>As with everything else in this module, you should feel free to use the assets however your group sees fit- but we do have a few tips to share that might help you to get the most out of them.</p><p><strong>Break The Rules</strong>: While the original Urban Grid map is laid out on a strict grid, a more naturalistic settlement layout is completely possible within Kingmaker's rules- your blocks don't have to be arranged in a 3x3 grid, nor do they have to be square. Instead, your settlement will look a lot more natural if it's build following the contours of of the terrain. It may help to place buildings before you start to add more structure through pathways, walls, and roads. You can even hold shift to place buildings entirely off of the grid, if you'd like!</p><p><strong>Hide Your Crimes</strong>: From time to time, the place where two tiles meet may not be ideal, leaving a sharp line. While we have provided \"end\" segments for roads and walls to provide a smoother transition, there may still be some cases where the edges of the tiles simply look odd against the background. Similarly, placing some buildings too close to existing trees on the scene may also look odd, as the trees should be above the buildings, not below them.</p><p>You can avoid some of these issues by layering assets, or concealing unwanted elements beneath other tiles. Notably, the various trees included in the decorative tiles can be an easy way to cover up any odd-looking edges for a more seamless view, and your players never need to know about the heinous crimes you've committed against aesthetic sensibilities.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>FAQ: How do I rotate 1x2 Buildings?</p></header><p>If you try to rotate one of the 1x2 buildings, you may find that the art rotates but the token's \"footprint\" does not. This is because the token's dimensions need to be changed- go into the token configuration, and set the dimensions to 2 squares wide by 1 square high, with a token scale of 2. This will allow for vertically aligned buildings to more cleanly snap to the grid without distorting the appearance of the building's image asset.</p><header class=\"split\"><p>FAQ: Why Can't I Pan the Canvas?</p></header><p>When placing tile assets during settlement building, you may find yourself in a situation where it seems like right-click to pan no longer works. This is likely because you've accidentally selected the large tile that serves as the scene's background image- you can deselect it with a simple left-click and drag.</p></section>"

The bastard son of a crusading Taldan knight and a Numerian noblewoman, Castruccio’s birth name was the even more flamboyant Mandalarucio. His father sent regular deliveries of gold from the field of battle, so he and his mother Cimany never wanted for wealth. Mandalarucio’s mother doted on him, paying for dance, music, and language lessons and parading him among the other nobles of Hajoth Hakados as often as possible. Mother and son knew little of hardship until the payments from Mandalarucio’s father—a man the future king never met—ceased with the elder’s death at the hands of the Worldwound’s demonic host. Cimany did her best to make ends meet, but she and her child had both grown used to extravagances, and within two months their funds had given out. The cutthroat aristocracy of Hajoth Hakados swiftly took action to reclaim the family estate, and just like that the two were out on the street.</p><p>After suffering another two months of indignities, Mandalarucio turned to crime, using occult magic to gain the confidence of rich visitors and then robbing them, leaving behind victims too shamed at being duped to pursue justice. Eventually, though, Mandalarucio made a critical error by attempting to con and rob a member of the Technic League. When the con went sour and the Technic League sorcerer lost his hand to Mandalarucio’s blade, the budding con artist went into hiding to escape punishment. But the Technic League didn’t need him to repay the blood debt—operating under the aegis of the Black Sovereign and the slanderous whispers of local aristocrats, they quickly found that the missing man had a mother. They arrested Cimany, and by the time Mandalarucio heard of her arrest, she’d already been executed.</p><p>When he learned of this development, Mandalarucio wasted no time. He stole into the inn the Technic League agents were staying at and extracted his revenge in a single night of red ruin. When the sun rose, the five Technic League agents were dead and the delivery of rare Numerian artifacts they had been entrusted with delivering to Starfall had vanished. Hajoth Hakados’s government had its suspicions, but the case was never solved, for Mandalarucio had fled Numeria entirely, never to return.</p><p>The next two years of his life were spent lying low in the River Kingdoms. He changed his name to Castruccio Irovetti, combining the first and last names of his mother’s favorite artists. He periodically sold off some of the Numerian artifacts he’d stolen for funds, but overall, he kept a low profile. It wasn’t until his wanderings took him to Pitax that his fortunes finally changed. After hearing rumors of strange treasures hidden in the forest called Thousand Voices, Irovetti entered the mysterious woodland in search of riches. It may have been his good looks and strong singing voice that attracted the attention of the cruel queen of Thousand Voices, but more likely it was the intrusive stink of the technological items he carried that caused the nymph Nyrissa to take special note of this latest intruder. She sent her minions against Irovetti to test him, but he defeated them all with a combination of his magic, his wits, and his Numerian devices.</p><p>Intrigued, Nyrissa realized that here was a perfect tool to use to increase her influence over the encroaching tide of civilization. She appeared before Irovetti, who in the face of such power had little choice but to fall to his knees in adoration. Nyrissa took Irovetti away for a month to her strange and wondrous realm in the First World. There she showed him great marvels and fearsome sights, and on the eve she returned him to Pitax, she granted him her favor and became his muse, giving him a lock of her hair. In return, she asked only that he perform one favor for her in the world of mortals—recovering a sword called Briar, lost long ago somewhere in the region. (For more information on how Nyrissa lost Briar, what the sword actually means to her, and why she can’t simply retrieve it on her own, see @UUID[JournalEntry.geHtEMsUzqsld8cx].)</p><p>With Nyrissa’s favor granting Irovetti even greater skill, he made his way to the city of Pitax. He reasoned that with a kingdom at his command, the search for a missing sword would be a trivial thing. Armed with his two remaining Numerian devices and an idea of how to become Pitax’s newest ruler, Irovetti wasted no time setting his plot into motion. One of his Numerian devices is a mindrender baton—a technological wonder capable of commanding false loyalty in a victim’s mind. Irovetti began building his reputation in the city by using the mindrender baton to aid in purchasing several warehouses for scandalously low prices and securing relationships and deals with several important merchants and smugglers. Eventually, he invited two of Pitax’s leaders, the brothers Lothaire and Berengar, to a card game at one of his warehouses. Through the use of his mindrender baton and magic (particularly modify memory), Irovetti swindled the brothers out of their rule; the next morning, neither had any memories of being duped, but Irovetti owned a signed document legally handing over all the possessions of the ruling family to him, including the crown of Pitax.</p><p>At first, Irovetti used his new resources as king of Pitax to search for Briar. But as the years wore on, his memories of his time with Nyrissa began to pale against the reality of the decadence and power that ruling a River Kingdom brought. While her influence continued to subtly manipulate Irovetti’s personality (and is in large part responsible for his founding of Pitax’s Academy of Grand Arts), her hold over his heart and lusts faded. So when several of Irovetti’s agents came to him years later with the good news that Briar had been found, Irovetti did something his fey patron hadn’t foreseen: he had his agents murdered before they could spread the news, then hid Briar away in a chamber deep under his palace. Irovetti feared that upon returning the sword to Nyrissa, she would cast him aside. He was not yet ready to lose the power her favor granted him, and he reasoned that he could simply rule Pitax for another decade or so and keep Briar’s recovery secret; then, when he grew tired of life as a king, he could announce to Nyrissa his “recent recovery” of Briar and enjoy the reward for his service to the fey queen.</p>"

For the most part, the Lantern King’s plots and shenanigans tilt toward the cruel, and while he’s long been a master at riding the proverbial razor’s edge between mischief and outright sadism (if only by conserving his cruelest plans for those who invite that cruelty by being cruel themselves, as in the case of Nyrissa), his latest actions have certainly drawn the notice of the other Eldest. As such, they have largely distanced themselves from him, and as a result of this, any defeat the PCs deal to him in this adventure goes not only unpunished by the Lantern King’s demigod siblings but will even be enforced, in a manner of speaking, by the other Eldest so that the Lantern King won’t seek continued revenge against the PCs for their victories. Whether or not this also serves to teach the capricious eldest a lesson to temper his need for mischief with occasional bouts of patience and even mercy, only time can tell.</p><p>The Lantern King’s direct interactions with the PCs in this campaign are via an avatar—a powerful proxy created from himself to rule over the Lantern Kingdom. While this avatar isn’t as powerful as the Lantern King himself, it remains the single most dangerous foe the party faces in Kingmaker. As a demigod, the Lantern King is an even more dangerous foe, equivalent in power to a 29th-level creature and possessing abilities beyond the scope of the core experience in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Some of these abilities, such as the power to manipulate reality, to create powerful artifacts like the Apology, and to build entire demiplane realms like the Hunting Dream or the Lantern Kingdom, manifest during the course of the Kingmaker Adventure Path not as rules content but as story elements the PCs will need to endure—see Chapter 11 of this book for more details.</p><p>In combat, the Lantern King’s avatar uses flight to remain out of melee for the first several rounds of combat, relying upon his spells to soften up the party before using his Strikes against them. He’s fond of taking actions that disrupt, torment, or mock the PCs rather than those specifically tailored to maximize damage. For example, he often uses Playful Switch to swap a flying PC in the air with one who’s on the ground and can’t fly, or he uses illusions to create false foes or locations that play off of previous failures or embarrassments the PCs may have endured during the campaign itself. By playing the Lantern King’s avatar in battle as more of a trickster than a cold-blooded killer, you’ll not only enforce his legendary personality upon your players, but you’ll also give their characters a bit more of a fighting chance against him in battle. He prefers to hold primal phenomenon in reserve to recover from an unwanted condition or situation, and as he realizes the PCs are dangerous foes, he abandons “playful tactics” for more serious or tactical decisions aimed toward defeating the party rather than toying with them.</p><p>While the Lantern King faces no lasting inconvenience if his avatar is slain, the sting of such a defeat is enough to compel the avatar to back down and ask for a truce if the PCs reduce him to fewer than 75 Hit Points. If the PCs agree to a truce, the avatar compliments their prowess and promises to turn his attentions away from the Stolen Lands. Furthermore, he agrees to any additional terms the PCs ask for, provided they are within his ability to grant. This includes restoring Nyrissa’s place and realm to the First World (although he cannot provide further information about her lost lover) and unmaking Briar to restore her capacity to love.</p>"

The lovers inspired each other to increasing acts of audacity, and it wasn’t long before Nyrissa began to think of herself as the newest of the Eldest and proclaimed this to any who would listen, beginning to build her own nation in the First World. Another of the Eldest, the Lantern King, saw opportunity for mayhem here. He spread his influence among his fellow demigods, and before long, several among the Eldest opposed Nyrissa’s claim and took steps to challenge her. First, they sent a jabberwock to destroy her, but Nyrissa defeated it and used its blood to create lesser jabberwocks under her own control. Then they attempted to rally a thousand powerful fey against her, but Nyrissa convinced those fey to serve her instead in return for a place in her domain. Finally, the Eldest exiled Count Ranalc to the Shadow Plane for helping to cause the problem in the first place. Suddenly, Nyrissa found herself without an ally among the Eldest. Having expended much of her energy and resources to defeat the jabberwock and recruit the thousand, she knew that she had lost the war and surrendered, apologizing for her acts.</p><p>The Lantern King decided that Nyrissa’s apology would suffice only for the jabberwock’s death; for her other deeds, he demanded a further punishment—Nyrissa’s capacity to love. Without love, the Lantern King argued to the other Eldest, Nyrissa would not be able to sway another of them to her side. However, if she could replace the “thousand fey breaths” she stole from the First World with a thousand stolen nations, they would accept her apology for her other actions and restore her capacity to love. Faced with no real option, Nyrissa agreed. She was allowed to keep her domain, now known as Thousandbreaths, but it was carved off to form its own demiplane to serve as a sort of prison. Her love was taken from her and transformed into the sword <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.vcs1LE9FHFZEQber]</em>, which was then entrusted to the Lantern King for safekeeping. He gifted Nyrissa with a chalice he called the Apology, an artifact capable of transforming Material Plane kingdoms she conquered into motes of sand. Once the Apology held a thousand motes of sand, those lands would be absorbed into the First World, Nyrissa would be forgiven, and love would be restored to her.</p><p>The matter settled, the Eldest quickly moved on with their own inscrutable agendas. Yet while they eventually forget about what they’d done to Nyrissa, the nymph herself did not. She grew more and more obsessed with her loss of love—or perhaps it was the loss of love that caused her to grow more violent and obsessed. In her early attempts to discover the location of <em>Briar</em>, she received the visions that would come to haunt her—that <em>Briar</em> would be returned to her, but only as an instrument of her own death.</p><p>Now she has but one kingdom left to claim: the new kingdom risen in the Stolen Lands. With the War of the River Kings over and one kingdom a victor, the time is right for the final grain to be added to the Apology. That this will destroy a significant region on Golarion is irrelevant to the loveless nymph; in her obsession, she fails to see that this act may be the very thing that drives her enemies from to slay her as in the vision.</p>"

When this cyclops tyrant was defeated during the chaos following Earthfall, one of his apprentices claimed his name as well as his greatest treasure, the Oculus of Abaddon. Though he had been the least of the necromancer’s apprentices, the new Vordakai was nevertheless a powerful wizard, but it would take more than power to claim the true Vordakai’s mantle. Betrayed by followers of the original leader who refused to serve him, the new Vordakai was sealed into his own tomb, and over the passage of eons, the cyclops lich atrophied.</p><p>Although much weakened today, Vordakai remains a dangerous opponent who can devastate a poorly prepared party on his own. Don’t be afraid to play Vordakai as arrogant creature—he has existed for longer than most creatures on Golarion, after all, and if he makes arrogant mistakes (such as neglecting to cast spells defensively or provoking Attacks of Opportunity), that not only gives the PCs a chance to survive but also helps to establish the ancient lich as both overconfident and a bit careless from his long period of quiescence. Keep in mind that Vordakai is the most powerful foe the PCs have encountered in the Kingmaker Adventure Path thus far, and in defeating him, they will accomplish something truly legendary.</p><p>The greatest diminishment of Vordakai’s power is represented through the loss of his soul cage—the magical item he initially used to trap his own soul and enable his transformation into a lich in the first place. He cannot create a replacement as long as he remains atrophied, but his arrogance works against him here. Only if he’s reduced below 20 Hit Points does he realize that the PCs have a very good chance to defeat him, and if he survives long enough to take a turn after this realization, he casts his 5th-level dimension door to flee to area C5 of his tomb. If he’s able to escape in this way, he’ll wait for a few days before returning to his tomb, infuriated if the PCs have released his prisoners and robbed him blind. At this point, Vordakai can become a recurring villain in your campaign!</p><p>In Vordakai’s case, he has forgotten much arcane lore and lost a significant amount of his spellcasting ability. At the height of his power, he was a 20th-level wizard, but today, his power has reduced to that of a 12th-level wizard. More troubling to the lich is the fact that he can no longer use a soul cage to rejuvenate—if Vordakai is destroyed, he crumbles to dust, forever dead. Given time, Vordakai could recover his power and regain his rejuvenation ability, but it’s unlikely the PCs will give him that chance, as it would take the lich several years to undo the ravages of centuries.</p><h3>Eclipsed Incantations</h3><p>Vordakai keeps his spells in a massive ironbound tome called Eclipsed Incantations (Bulk 3).

His father Evan, a cousin of the Garess family patriarch, disowned Kesten, who then fled to Restov to seek work as a mercenary.

In truth, Jhod has been all but excommunicated from the priesthood after he helped form a mob against a traveler in his home village who he thought was a werewolf responsible for several recent killings. Only a few hours after they killed the man, the true murderer was caught by a hunter and revealed to be nothing more sinister than a particularly wily warg.</p><p>An investigation by the church of Erastil followed, and they found Jhod’s involvement in the village’s overly aggressive pursuit of the traveler’s death to be actionable. Only the fact that the investigators’ search of the man’s belongings revealed the traveler as a bandit spy sent to case the town kept the church from fully excommunicating the priest—and even then, only if he accepted exile. After the trial, Jhod traveled from his home in Galt up the Sellen and into Numeria. From there, his wanderings eventually brought him east into Brevoy, where he had a particularly vivid dream about an overgrown temple of Erastil guarded by a huge, angry bear. Upon waking from the dream, Jhod felt an irresistible tug to the south; he now believes that Erastil has given him a chance to redeem himself. The sensation led Jhod to Oleg’s Trading Post, but there it stopped—and soon after, he learned from Svetlana about the PCs and their charter. Jhod has also heard rumors of “lost temples” to Erastil in the Stolen Lands, and the first time the PCs return to the trading post after Jhod’s arrival, he tracks them down and asks them to keep an eye out for anything of that nature—particularly an old temple guarded by something that’s not quite a normal angry bear.</p><section class=\"quest\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>Vision of the Elk</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>30 XP</li></ul></header><article><p>Jhod Kavken asks the PCs to seek out a lost temple of Erastil that he’s heard of in his travels.

There are two categories of kingdom events: story events that occur as a result of the campaign plotline and random events.</p><p>Story events are resolved when they occur, as detailed in the earlier chapters of this Adventure Path and often include greater details for how the PCs can take part in resolving the event. These events take place during regular play even though they draw upon kingdom statistics. They’re usually resolved during downtime.</p><p>Random events are resolved entirely by the kingdom itself and take place within the @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.haAwaaMEbW4BWAuK] of a Kingdom turn. A flat check at the start of this phase determines whether a random event occurs, although you could roll this check in advance for any number of Kingdom turns or even just choose which events are going to take place for a span of time. Determining the events that will play out in advance gives you the ability to build narratives during play to foreshadow upcoming events (so that when they occur, they aren’t completely unexpected) and might inspire interesting ways to combine events with the ongoing campaign’s story.</p><h2>Resolving Kingdom Events</h2><p>All kingdom events resolve in downtime, although for some story events, there may be periods of exploration or encounter mode before or after an event’s resolution. Some kingdom events grant boons or benefits, while others can harm a kingdom by costing resources, increasing Unrest or Ruin, penalizing activities, or damaging structures. In many cases, the PCs will be able to attempt Kingdom skill checks to bolster benefits or minimize disasters.</p><p>It’s possible to have more than one kingdom event occur during a Kingdom turn.

Each kingdom event has a list of traits that convey its properties at a glance. <strong>Beneficial</strong> events provide boons and benefits to the kingdom. <strong>Dangerous</strong> events threaten the kingdom. <strong>Continuous</strong> events play out during multiple consecutive Event phases until the event has been resolved (see the event’s Resolution entry). <strong>Hex</strong> events take place in a specific hex in the kingdom, while <strong>Settlement</strong> events take place in a specific settlement—skill checks to resolve these events receive item bonuses only from structures that influence that hex (in the case of a hex event) or that are part of that settlement (in the case of a settlement event). Hex and Settlement events’ effects may be enhanced or diminished if the site has (or lacks) specific features.</p><p><strong>Location</strong> This entry explains how to determine where a hex or settlement event takes place; the entry is omitted from kingdom-wide events.</p><p><strong>Event</strong> The event’s effect on the kingdom is described here, along with any skill checks that can be attempted to affect the event.</p><p><strong>Kingdom Skill</strong> This lists the Kingdom skill that’s used to determine the outcome of the event, along with any situational modifiers; <strong>Leader</strong> PC leaders are particularly helpful in resolving events. If the leadership role listed here is occupied by a PC who is not incurring a vacancy penalty, the check made to determine the event’s outcome gains a +1 circumstance bonus; this bonus increases to +2 once a kingdom reaches 9th level, and to +3 at 15th level.

A charter granted by an established entity gives the kingdom a much-needed enhancement right at the start, typically manifesting as boosts to two of the kingdom’s @UUID[.ej53SbHZcENqNUT6] and a flaw to a third score. In effect, a charter bolsters two aspects of a kingdom, but one other aspect is held back to the benefit of the charter’s holder.</p><p>Most charters apply a flaw to one specific ability, a boost to another specific ability, and a “free” boost, which can be applied to any score that the charter doesn’t specifically affect. For example, the Conquest charter specifically gives a boost to Loyalty and a flaw to Culture, so the free boost can be applied to either Economy or Stability.</p><p>In Kingmaker, the PCs earn their charter from Jamandi Aldori as thanks for dealing with the threat posed by the Stag Lord. (Outside of Kingmaker, the method by which a kingdom secures a charter can vary, but the most organic method is for the GM to grant one in the form of a quest reward.)</p><p>Over time, the PCs’ kingdom may grow more independent or they could secure additional aid and support from other nations. None of those developments will replace or adjust the important initial boosts and flaw they’ll earn at the very start of their kingdom’s history—once the PCs have chosen their charter, the boosts and flaw it grants are permanent.</p><article class=\"blockgroup icons\"><section class=\"block\"><section class=\"spotlight\"><article><h3>Conquest Charter</h3><p>Your sponsors have conquered an area and its former leaders have been routed or even killed.

Each role grants the kingdom different benefits, provided a character—be it a PC or an NPC—takes up the mantle of serving in that role. A character can only fill one leadership role at a time, but it’s important to have all eight roles filled, for when a kingdom goes without a leader, problems arise.</p><p>If unexpected events (such as the death of a character) remove a leader from a leadership role, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.vHKPoZycxZAA1vpz] kingdom activity may immediately be used to assign a new leader to that role—even outside of a Kingdom turn.</p><p>Each character in a leadership role (whether PC or NPC) must spend a week of downtime activity each month attending to their duties (though these seven days need not be consecutive). This downtime works just the same as time spent retraining a feat or skill; a character can take multiple downtime activities during the course of a month as time allows. A character can attend to their duties even if they take on a downtime activity with a longer time requirement (such as retraining a class feature, which requires at least a month); in this case, simply break up the time required for that longer activity over the course of consecutive months, leaving seven days during each month for leadership activities. NPCs assigned to leadership roles are presumed to meet the downtime requirement automatically unless the PCs deliberately have them step away from the job (likely to accompany them on adventures). If a character does not spend this downtime, at the start of the @UUID[.WWGNrRZ1dkTjz5Il] of the next Kingdom turn, they either incur their role’s vacancy penalty (see below) or lose one of their leadership activities for that turn.</p><p>There is an advantage to assigning a leadership role to a PC rather than an NPC. Each @UUID[JournalEntry.36YItDu6VgX6IRWV.JournalEntryPage.VAhDGpHpEexUkszK] specifies a leader, and if that leader is a PC who is not incurring a vacancy penalty, the kingdom receives a bonus to the kingdom check that determines the event’s outcome.</p><p>Some benefits require that a role be invested. In step 7 of @UUID[.oBEEIVtLmNIN3meL], the players select 4 leadership roles to be invested; at the start of each Kingdom turn, they may reselect the roles that are invested (see Assign Leadership Roles). Note that when certain companions detailed in the Kingmaker Companion Guide hold the leadership roles listed in their entry in that book, those roles are automatically invested; this is in addition to the four roles the players choose to invest.</p><h3>Role Mechanics</h3><p><strong>Key Ability</strong>: This lists the kingdom ability score that is most impacted by the leader. When this role is invested, all Kingdom skill checks based on this ability gain a +1 status bonus. This bonus increases to +2 when the kingdom reaches 8th level, and then to +3 when the kingdom reaches 16th level.</p><p>Since status bonuses don’t stack (see @UUID[.0thiaA1x5SKtPES5]), you may want to invest one role that benefits each of the 4 kingdom abilities—but since each leadership role offers other unique benefits to the kingdom, spreading out the roles in that way may not always be the best choice!</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty</strong>: At the start of each Kingdom turn, if any leader has not spent the required week of downtime in that role (see above) since the end of the last Kingdom turn, they must either give up one of the three activities they would take during the Leadership Activities step of the Activity phase, or apply this penalty until the start of the next Kingdom turn.

Instead they begin this process at the start of @UUID[JournalEntry.36YItDu6VgX6IRWV], after their victory over the Stag Lord convinces the leaders of Brevoy to grant the PCs a charter to establish their own kingdom in the Stolen Lands.</p><p>Ruling a kingdom takes a lot of the PCs’ time, so to ensure that your gaming group has plenty of uninterrupted time for more traditional adventuring, the rules presented in this appendix take place entirely in downtime. The mechanics treat the kingdom itself as a sort of additional character in the party, so players who know how to navigate and level up their own characters should find managing a kingdom relatively easy.</p><p>Though these rules use the word “kingdom” to refer to the nation ruled by the PCs, their government doesn’t need to be a monarchy. Likewise, titles like “queen” or “king” may differ from the terms the PCs choose for their leaders (and in any case, gender has no mechanical role in the kingdom rules).</p><p>These rules are focused specifically on the Kingmaker Adventure Path and so include only elements appropriate for its setting and storyline. You won’t find rules for building kingdoms in the desert or on the ocean, nor will you find events involving monsters that don’t make sense in the Stolen Lands or buildings that aren’t thematically appropriate for the storyline. If you wish to use these rules to run kingdoms outside of Kingmaker, you may need to adjust these rules to fit your game.</p><h3>Working Together</h3><p>More so than typical Pathfinder campaigns, Kingmaker assumes that the PCs work together. These rules assume that all of the PCs have roles as leaders in the nation, and that they’re all focused on making their kingdom prosperous and stable, rather than stealing from the treasury, oppressing the citizens (or each other), or striking out on their own to start competing kingdoms. Before starting this campaign, you should make sure your players understand this assumption and build appropriate characters.</p>"

Building specialized structures can increase this number on a per‑Commodity basis.</p><h2>Expanding a Kingdom</h2><p>A kingdom grows one hex at a time on the Stolen Lands map, via Region activities like Claim Hex and Clear Hex. The PCs can pursue these activities during the @UUID[.iDwdTiQzEumX3Sop] of each Kingdom turn.</p><h3>Losing Hexes</h3><p>It’s possible to lose control of a hex. When this happens, the kingdom immediately loses any benefits from terrain improvements in that hex, and all settlements in that hex become Freeholds (page 536). Monsters may move into an abandoned hex, increasing the chance for random encounters, and if you wish to reclaim the hex, you may need to clear it first of hostile creatures. Each hex lost decreases a kingdom’s Size by 1. This affects the kingdom’s statistics, such as the type of its Resource Die.</p><p>If one or more hexes are lost in such a way that it breaks the connection between parts of a kingdom, so that all of the hexes are no longer contiguous with other hexes of the kingdom, whatever portion of the territory contains the capital becomes the primary territory and the rest of the kingdom becomes its secondary territory. All Kingdom skill checks made to resolve issues associated with secondary territories take a –4 circumstance penalty. When a kingdom starts a turn with any number of secondary territories, increase Unrest by 1. Once a secondary territory is connected to the primary territory via at least one hex, it becomes part of the primary territory.</p><p>If a kingdom is reduced to 0 hexes, whether through Unrest, a disaster, war with another kingdom, or any other effect, the PCs are at risk of having their rule end. On their next Kingdom turn, they must claim at least one new hex and establish or claim at least one settlement, or their kingdom is considered totally destroyed, and they must start over. In this case, you should have the PCs undertake a new adventure of your design to secure a new charter.</p>"

This should not be confused with the \"Resource\" trait, which is used more generally to refer to any characteristic of a hex which might be of use to the Kingdom, such as a landmark or a bridge.</p><p>I've done my best to draw a distinction between these various concepts, including by renaming the \"Resource\" terrain feature to \"Resource Node\" in some places. However, it's inevitable that the use of such similar terms for related but different concepts will lead to confusion. If you find any aspect of the rules or my presentation of them to be unsatisfactory, I would appreciate your feedback. In the meantime, I strongly recommend that you feel empowered to modify or tweak the rules presented here in order to fit your group's needs.</p></section><h2>Resource Points</h2><p>A kingdom’s Resource Points (RP) represent a combination of the work of a kingdom’s citizens and the time spent on jobs, talent, labor, tools, and funds to handle this toil. Resource points do not directly represent amounts of coins in a treasury, but rather an abstraction of the nation’s total amount of available funds to handle tasks. Since luck and demand play a part in a kingdom’s resources, the exact total of RP a kingdom will have each turn varies; a new total of RP is rolled at the start of each Kingdom turn (page 538) using Resource Dice. Any RP not spent by the end of that turn convert to kingdom XP at a rate of 1 RP to 1 XP. Whenever the kingdom is forced to spend RP that would drop it below 0, spend all the RP the kingdom has and then increase a Ruin of the PCs’ choice by 1.</p><h3>Resource Dice</h3><p>A kingdom’s economy is based on the sum of the productive activity of its citizens, and that activity is reflected in a quantity of resources that the kingdom can tap into each month. These resources are represented by Resource Points (see below) which are determined by Resource Dice, with the number of dice being equal to the nation’s level + 4. When a kingdom is first founded, each Resource Die is a d4, but as the kingdom advances in Size, its Resource Die increases to d6, d8, d10, or d12 (see the @UUID[.kitlt28oPiGVyHCH] table).</p><h2>Commodities</h2><p>As a kingdom grows, it stockpiles resources beyond those required for day‑to‑day life. These resources are known as Commodities and are used to build structures in settlements, to trade for @UUID[.lCLywHaoPOPdhXrm] using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.swAA2zetF14HIhUc] activity, or to expend during kingdom events.</p><p>The types of Commodities that are available include Food, Lumber, Luxuries, Ore, and Stone. As kingdoms accumulate or expend these Commodities, track the numbers on the kingdom sheet. Unless specialized storage improvements have been built in its settlements, a kingdom is limited to a maximum number of stored Commodities in each category as determined by its @UUID[.kitlt28oPiGVyHCH]. Commodities gathered in excess of this storage limit are lost.</p><p>Each type of Commodity can be gathered by special activities as detailed below, but Commodities can also be discovered via kingdom events or while exploring the Stolen Lands, earned as rewards for quests, purchased from allies via @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.VadpbmRYNXSX7g8z], or acquired via @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.3qJcDEZNwJV6hpkg].</p><p><strong>Food</strong> stockpiles are expended to pay for Consumption during the Upkeep phase of a Kingdom turn, but also when faced with famines or other disasters, and to keep armies fed during times of war (as described in those events). Food is gathered with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.o81alpjEki9cESun], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.rXNZTmesfoBln2vs], or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.l0Wlgj6LaDNRRUa6].</p><p><strong>Lumber</strong> is used to build structures during the Civic Activities step of the Activity phase of a Kingdom turn, and it is gathered from lumber camps built by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.8B6PmgtMH2TthBSX].</p><p><strong>Luxuries</strong> are used to build specialized structures or are expended during certain encounters, generally those with high stakes or magical effects.

Other events can reduce or increase a Ruin’s point total as well—typically as the result of kingdom activities or events.</p><p><strong>Ruin Threshold</strong>: Each Ruin has a threshold; a point at which the penalties associated with that Ruin increase. A Ruin’s initial threshold is 10, but each threshold increases as the kingdom levels up and becomes more able to withstand Ruin in all its forms.

For example, if your kingdom has a Corruption penalty of –4, it takes a –4 item penalty on all Culture checks. Reducing Ruin Penalties: When a kingdom reaches 5th level, and then again every 3 levels thereafter, it gains Ruin resistance; each time it does so, it has the opportunity to reduce an existing Ruin penalty to 0. This is an extremely effective way to manage a Ruin penalty that’s crept particularly high, but it’s also an extremely limited resource, as a kingdom will only get, at most, 6 opportunities to adjust a Ruin penalty in this way over the course of a campaign.

First, choose two different kingdom abilities to receive additional boosts. Then, total the boosts and flaws the kingdom has received for each ability, and record the final ability score and its associated modifier on the kingdom sheet. Remember that ability scores start at 10, boosts add 2, and flaws subtract 2. For example, if a kingdom’s Loyalty received two boosts and a flaw, its Loyalty ability score is 12 (10+4-2), so its Loyalty modifier is +1.</p><header class=\"split underlined\"><h3>Step 6: Record Kingdom Details</h3></header><p>The PCs should choose a name for their kingdom.

It’s best if the party works together to assign these roles. Then, assign any remaining roles to NPCs whom the PCs have allied with and who are capable and willing to serve in a leadership role.</p><p>Next, choose four leadership roles to invest. Investing a role provides a status bonus to Kingdom skill checks based on that role’s key ability (see Key Ability on page 514 and table on 516). Invest roles assigned to PCs first (so if your party has fewer than four PCs, you’ll invest only enough NPC roles to make up the difference).</p><p>These initial leadership assignments happen as part of the founding of the kingdom and do not require a kingdom activity to occur. Once the kingdom is established, adjusting leadership requires using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.vHKPoZycxZAA1vpz] kingdom activity.</p><p>Then, each of the four invested leaders chooses to apply the trained proficiency rank to a different @UUID[.0thiaA1x5SKtPES5]. You may not choose skills that already received training from your choice of government type. These proficiency ranks cannot be reassigned later.</p><p>On the kingdom sheet, record the leader you assigned to each role and indicate the four roles you invested. Record a +1 status bonus to the skill associated with each invested role’s key ability, and record the four skills that your nation received training in.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header><h4>Choosing Leaders on the Kingdom Actor Sheet</h4></header><p>You can rapidly assign leaders to their chosen roles by dragging and dropping an actor from the Actors Sidebar Tab to their role on the Kingdom Actor Sheet.</p></section><header class=\"split underlined\"><h3>Step 8: First Village</h3><h3>@UUID[JournalEntry.BIu4C1T1RR17QNwl]</h3></header><p>Somewhere in that heartland hex lies the kingdom’s first village—the capital. Rules for founding settlements begin @UUID[JournalEntry.BIu4C1T1RR17QNwl.JournalEntryPage.3ys44au8VRA1InlJ], but the players can skip Step 1 and Step 2 of that process when founding this village. Since this is their first village, the PCs gain 40 kingdom XP as a @UUID[.OOd83sXDOoWIyGAl]; record it on the kingdom sheet, along with the capital’s name. If the site the PCs have chosen has any established structures listed in the hex’s resources in Chapter 2, place them in blocks of the PCs’ choice on an @UUID[JournalEntry.BIu4C1T1RR17QNwl.JournalEntryPage.y7f0lbubZNDW5Zhj]. (The PCs won’t add new structures to the settlement before their first Kingdom turn.)</p><header class=\"split underlined\"><h3>Step 9: Calculate Skill Modifiers</h3><h3>@UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.0thiaA1x5SKtPES5]</h3></header><p>With the big decisions made, it’s time to calculate modifiers for each of the kingdom’s skills. Each skill is associated with a specific ability (see page 516), and the initial modifier for each skill consists of the ability modifier for the associated ability, plus a proficiency bonus, plus a status bonus for skills that receive them from invested leadership roles. (There are several other types of bonuses and penalties that can affect skill modifiers later in the campaign; leave those boxes empty for now.)</p><section class=\"skill center\"><p>Initial modifier = modifier of the skill’s key ability score + proficiency bonus + status bonus</p></section><p>If a kingdom is not proficient in a skill, the proficiency bonus is +0; if a kingdom is trained in a skill, the proficiency bonus is that kingdom’s level plus 2. (It’s not possible to attain proficiency ranks beyond trained until 3rd level.)</p><p>For example, the Agriculture skill is associated with Loyalty. If the kingdom’s Loyalty modifier is +1, and it is untrained in Agriculture, then its Agriculture skill modifier is +1. If that 1st-level kingdom is trained in Agriculture, though, add to that a proficiency bonus of 3 (the kingdom’s level plus 2). If a leadership role that provides a status bonus to Loyalty-based checks (Ruler or Emissary) is invested, add another 1.</p><p>Calculate the initial modifiers for all skills and record them on the kingdom sheet.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header><h4>Automatic Modifier Calculation</h4></header><p>If you are using the Kingdom Actor Sheet all of the modifiers are automatically configured by default.</p></section><header class=\"split underlined\"><h3>Step 10: Fame or Infamy?</h3><h3>@UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.mriZ3uO2ggsPpA2y]</h3></header><p>Finally, the PCs should decide if they want their kingdom to aspire to fame or infamy. A famous kingdom seeks to bolster its citizens, forge alliances with neighbors, or oppose the rise of cruelty, while an infamous kingdom uses its citizens as resources, undermines and sabotages its neighbors, or actively seeks warfare. It’s an oversimplification to call a famous kingdom a “good” kingdom or an infamous kingdom an “evil” one, and disruptive elements like crime or corruption will harm an infamous kingdom as surely as a famous one. As such, kingdoms do not have alignments to track. The choice here solely determines whether the kingdom uses Fame or Infamy points and the influence certain structures might have on the kingdom.

Many attempts have been made to settle them, but to date, none have succeeded, making these 35,000 square miles of wilderness the largest swath of unclaimed land in the entire River Kingdoms. As tensions mount in Brevoy, one of Rostland’s swordlords hopes to change that fact; she plans to issue charters to several groups of adventurers, sending them south into the Stolen Lands to reopen old trade routes and defeat the bandits and monsters who have made them too dangerous to use. By sending free agents south, this swordlord of Rostland hopes to create new allies without sacrificing her own position of power in Brevoy.</p><p>Yet as with most complex and brilliant plans, the future holds plenty of opportunities for disaster.</p></aside><p>The Kingmaker Adventure Path begins as the player characters attend a feast at Lady Jamandi Aldori’s manor in Brevoy, where she reveals to all those in attendance her plans to transform the Stolen Lands into a new nation. After a night of unexpected chaos, where the PCs get their first chance to impress Lady Aldori by helping to defend her home against a group of criminals, they’re given their first assignment. The PCs are sent into the Stolen Lands to begin taming the wilderness, with the goal of eventually establishing a brand new nation.</p><p>Before they can get truly started, though, they need to begin exploring the wilderness. Using a remote trading post (which is also dealing with frequent bandit raids) as an initial base of operations, the PCs start to explore and map the Stolen Lands. It won’t be long before they clash against the most dangerous bandits in the region—a band led by a notorious villain known as the Stag Lord. Locating the Stag Lord’s base of operations requires exploration and, when the fort is discovered, careful planning and a bit of luck to prevail against the Stag Lord and his brutal bandit minions.</p><p>With the Stag Lord’s defeat, the PCs establish themselves as a dominant force in the region, and they can begin to build. A wide range of threats reveal themselves as their kingdom grows, including a troll uprising, an attack by an immense owlbear, political operatives from the neighboring kingdom of Pitax waging a propaganda war, and a sinister cult of Lamashtu who hope to merge the magic of the First World with that of the Abyss. The greatest threat the PCs will face may go unnoticed at first. The nymph queen Nyrissa has been cursed by a demigod known as the Lantern King, and in order to escape her fate, she must destroy nations, and the PCs’ new kingdom sits at the top of her list to ruin.</p><p>When the population of nearby Varnhold vanishes, the PCs are drawn east into conflict with an ancient cyclops lich named Vordakai. By defeating him, the PCs’ nation grows significantly, drawing further attention from competitors to the east—the baron of the nearby town of Fort Drelev, the Tiger Lord barbarians, and the jealous ruler of the neighboring nation of Pitax. As the PCs clash against these new foes, their nation’s strength only grows, and in time it becomes a full‑fledged kingdom.</p><p>It’s at this point that the ruler of Pitax, King Irovetti, makes a fateful move. He invites the PCs to take part in a tournament, but this invitation is nothing more than a distraction during which he launches an attack on the PCs’ nation. The War of the River Kings follows, and if the PCs can defeat King Irovetti they’ll be able to ally with or even annex the city of Pitax, spread their kingdom further, and explore some of their realm’s most dangerous locations.</p><p>Eventually, the Stolen Lands are stolen no more, and become a thriving nation of their own under the rule of the player characters. It’s at this point the nymph queen Nyrissa makes her move and the PCs finally learn the true depth of her influence over the events they’ve experienced in the campaign. Nyrissa invades the PCs’ kingdom from the First World, infesting the realm with supernatural blooms of fey power and uprisings of strange and deadly monsters. The PCs must confront Nyrissa in her eerie realm if they wish to keep their kingdom. Yet with her defeat a greater truth is revealed. Whether the PCs defeat Nyrissa in combat or forgive her for her past misdeeds, the Lantern King grows angry. A final confrontation with this potent demigod will test the PCs to their limits, and could not only save Nyrissa from her fate but change the future of the River Kingdoms forever!</p>"

As with all of Paizo’s Adventure Paths, Kingmaker has a lively community <a href=\"http://localhost:30000/paizo.com/community/forums\" title=\"Paizo Forum\">forum</a> online.

While those who have played that version of the campaign will find familiar elements within these pages, much has changed. We’ve added to the beginning and ending, as well as expanding several adventure sites within the Stolen Lands. Some of these draw inspiration from Owlcat’s Pathfinder: Kingmaker computer game, while others are entirely new to this book. Many of these revisions were inspired by extensive player feedback on the <em><code>paizo.com</code></em> forums.</p><p>If you’re new to Kingmaker, now’s your chance to experience a campaign that became legendary, a full sandbox experience where your players can chart the course of their own nation!</p></aside><figure><img width=\"200\" src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/journal-kingdom/crown.webp\" /></figure></section><h2>RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN</h2><p>Kingmaker features a primary storyline summarized in the Campaign Synopsis section on the previous page, but there is no set path that the PCs must follow as the story unfolds. This type of campaign, known as a sandbox, brings specific challenges. The framework of the story— particularly the points at which NPCs make requests of the PCs—is meant to guide the players, but for large portions of the campaign, they’ll determine the direction the adventure actually takes. The more familiar you are with the contents of this book, the easier it will be for you to stay a step or two ahead of the PCs.</p><p>One of the primary difficulties in running a sandbox is that the locations the PCs choose to explore won’t necessarily hold challenges appropriate for their level; they can stumble into an encounter that’s well beyond their capabilities or one so easy that it’s no challenge at all. So, throughout this book, each encounter is assigned a numeric severity level equal to the character level that we expect most parties to be at when they encounter that content. When your party is heading into an encounter that’s above their level, consider giving them a bit of advance warning in the form of ominous clues, disturbing omens, or even something as obvious as having them find an old signpost with the words “DANGER AHEAD” scrawled on it. You can also use the NPCs they encounter along the way to guide them; friendly allies can warn the party of terrible threats near their intended destination or suggest reasons to explore more suitable locations instead. The map of the Stolen Lands breaks this campaign into 20 different zones; you can use the @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U.JournalEntryPage.LCdukChAYoW5bXvO] table as a handy guide to determine how dangerous a region is before the PCs enter it.</p><p>Kingmaker offers many more possible encounters for each level than a party actually needs to advance in power. This means that some of the encounters might never occur in your game, and that’s fine! You can always save encounters or even entire dungeons for use in other campaigns. Certainly, a group who accomplishes every single encounter in this campaign will eventually outpace the challenges and find themselves reaching 20th level well before the campaign’s end. If you and your group are okay with this, that’s fine; it can be fun to blast through content with powerful characters, after all! If you want to spread things out, you can use the slow advancement speed as detailed on page 509 of the Core Rulebook so that the PCs will need to complete more encounters.</p><h3>Milestone or Experience?</h3><p>For a sandbox game like Kingmaker, story‑based leveling can be awkward since a big part of the fun of a sandbox campaign is the freedom to explore, get in over your head, retreat and build up power, then return for a rematch against a foe that was once too powerful. Without experience points to represent their progression through the game, players lack a method of tracking and anticipating when they’ll be gaining levels, and this can complicate play. If you decide to abandon XP and simply choose when the characters level up, it’s recommended that you use 19 specific milestones that, as the PCs complete them, provide excellent points for the party to level up. The @UUID[.CfMVHpKH8GljscF7] table lists 19 potential milestones, and can also help the GM visualize the expected progression of the party’s journey through this campaign.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>Amid the constant threat of civil war, the inhabitants of Brevoy have more pressing concerns than their neighbors’ ancestries, and few judge anyone by that alone. Brevans value custom and loyalty; thus, anyone who adheres to local traditions enjoys a high degree of tolerance and acceptance. As such, the region boasts a diverse population.</p><p>Characters don’t have to be from Brevoy to play the Kingmaker Adventure Path, but since the campaign begins as the party receives a charter from the swordlords of Restov, and the initial approach into the Stolen Lands is from Brevoy, players should consider how members of their character’s ancestry and class function in this northern kingdom.</p><p>The common ancestries from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> all work seamlessly with Kingmaker. If a player is considering a rare or uncommon ancestry from another source, the GM should consider challenges and opportunities the story and setting may present for that character, as highlighted below.</p><h3>Thematic Ancestries</h3><p>Groups of antagonistic kobolds and lizardfolk reside in the Stolen Lands, so players who make characters with these ancestries may have to make difficult choices. Alternately, the presence of such a PC can, at the GM’s discretion, make alliances with these groups more likely.</p><p>With Kingmaker’s thematic ties to the First World, a leshy character could be a fun player option. Likewise, a sprite character might find themselves faced with unexpected advantages or disadvantages in portions of this adventure where the First World has a stronger role. It’s best for a sprite PC to have no knowledge of the Adventure Path’s key villains and very limited knowledge of the First World; a sprite who has lived their whole life on the Material Plane works better in Kingmaker than one who is more familiar with the First World’s strangeness.</p><p>The proximity of Numeria to the Stolen Lands also makes it likely that some androids and ratfolk have drifted east into the region.</p><h3>Unaffiliated Ancestries</h3><p>Hobgoblins, along with many of the versatile heritages such as those touched by the planes or beastkin, aren’t that common in the region, but neither are they unknown or as unexpected as something like catfolk or tengu. And unlike lizardfolk or kobolds, most in the Stolen Lands don’t hold a bias against these ancestries, and they make relatively safe, low-impact options for PCs in Kingmaker. (For a PC with a versatile heritage such as changeling, dhampir, or one of the planar scions, their primary ancestry will also impact how well they fit in Kingmaker.) While azarketi would also fit this category, the lack of opportunities to excel in underwater or aquatic environments makes them a particularly poor choice for this campaign.</p><h3>Unusual Ancestries</h3><p>Catfolk, fetchlings, fleshwarps, kitsune, strix, and tengu are not well-known in the Stolen Lands; if players choose from these options, they may often be regarded as unusual or curious visitors by denizens in the River Kingdoms. GMs might want to play up some NPCs’ reactions to characters of unexpected ancestries, or consider altering some NPC ancestries to match those characters—if only to help explain why some people in the Stolen Lands know that a catfolk isn’t a werecreature!</p>"

A few things to keep in mind for each of the classes are summarized below.</p><article class=\"blockgroup\"><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.XwfcJuskrhI9GIjX]</h3><p>While alchemy doesn’t play a particularly important role in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em>, an alchemist still has plenty of opportunities to shine in this campaign, particularly if they focus their research as chirurgeons or mutagenists.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.YDRiP7uVvr9WRhOI]</h3><p>The most active barbarians within the Stolen Lands are the Tiger Lords, but they’re a violent band of warmongers who play the role of antagonists in the campaign. As such, the Tiger Lords make a poor choice for a PC affiliation. If a player wants their barbarian character to have an affiliation with a local group, work with your GM to generate specifics. If a player chooses to play a member of the Tiger Lords, GMs should work with them to ensure that they won’t have knowledge about the current activities of the group to avoid spoiling plotlines. An exiled Tiger Lord barbarian could make for a compelling character who eventually could help the party to more easily recruit the Tiger Lords as allies. The most thematic instincts for a Kingmaker barbarian include animal, dragon, and fury.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.3gweRQ5gn7szIWAv]</h3><p>A bard’s ability to sway crowds and manipulate social events will often come in handy during Kingmaker. All bard muses are appropriate choices for Kingmaker, particularly if a bard’s specific muse is associated with Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, or the First World. King Irovetti, the ruler of the neighboring kingdom of Pitax, fancies himself a renowned artist and entertainer, yet stifles the artists in his realm, so a bard character who fled Pitax could have a ready-made goal to return and start a cultural revolution. Such a bard should not be someone who views King Irovetti as an ally or a source of inspiration, though!</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.x8iwnpdLbfcoZkHA]</h3><p>Holy warriors are relatively uncommon in the River Kingdoms, though they are not completely absent from the region. Champions who serve Cayden Cailean, Desna, Erastil, or Shelyn are the most thematically appropriate choices for Kingmaker.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.EizrWvUPMS67Pahd]</h3><p>All nations have need of healers and spiritual leaders, but those struggling to find their footing at the edge of civilization benefit most from the presence of clerics. While clerics of any faith will find roles in this campaign, deities who have strong thematic ties to events in Kingmaker include Calistria, Cayden Cailean, Desna, Erastil, Gorum, Gozreh, and Shelyn.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.7s57JDCaiYYCAdFx]</h3><p>Druidic traditions are strong in the Stolen Lands, particularly those linked to the First World. The worship of Gozreh and members the Green Faith are the most common druidic traditions followed in the region, while the animal, leaf, and wild druidic orders are the most appropriate choices for Kingmaker.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.8zn3cD6GSmoo1LW4]</h3><p>The esteemed and exclusive schools of the Aldori swordlords train many of Brevoy’s numerous fighters, especially in the southern region of Rostland, so Kingmaker is an excellent opportunity to play a character interested in eventually becoming a swordlord. Alternately, with a focus on mass combat later in the story, a fighter who builds toward a role as a general can be an appropriate choice.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.Z9li154CPNmun29Q]</h3><p>The people of Brevoy and the River Kingdoms know about guns, but these weapons remain incredibly rare in the region. As this is an uncommon class, a player should work with their GM before building a gunslinger, and the GM should be comfortable adjusting the campaign as needed to support this type of character’s specialized resource needs.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.30qVs46dVNflgQNx]</h3><p>Inventors certainly exist in Brevoy and the River Kingdoms, particularly those who are influenced by the futuristic technology of neighboring Numeria. Since rules for advanced technology are not available for Pathfinder Second Edition at this time, a player could reskin and adjust descriptions of an inventor PC’s abilities and creations to give them a Numerian feel, provided the GM approves. As with the gunslinger, since this is an uncommon class, the player should work with their GM before building an inventor.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.4wrSCyX6akmyo7Wj]</h3><p>There are plenty of mysteries in the Stolen Lands, and an investigator will have plenty to do throughout this campaign. All investigator methodologies are thematically appropriate for Kingmaker.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.HQBA9Yx2s8ycvz3C]</h3><p>While there are no significant organizations associated with this class in the Stolen Lands, the magus is hardly unknown to the people of Brevoy or the River Kingdoms. All categories of hybrid study for the magus work well for the campaign.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.YPxpk9JbMnKjbNLc]</h3><p>As there are no established or significant monastic orders in the Stolen Lands or the surrounding regions, a traveling explorer or pilgrim likely makes the most sense for a monk character. A monk who seeks to establish their own order may well find an opportunity to do so while the party’s kingdom expands.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.pWHx4SXcft9O2udP]</h3><p>Oracles are an excellent thematic choice for this campaign, particularly their curses, though it’s probably best to keep an oracle’s curse self-contained rather than shoehorn it into larger plots in the campaign. The most thematically appropriate mysteries for an oracle are ancestors, battle, life, and tempest.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.Inq4gH3P5PYjSQbD]</h3><p>Psychics are not well-known in the Stolen Lands, and most who encounter one would be quick to assume the character is some sort of sorcerer. Emotional acceptance is a strong thematic choice for your subconscious mind.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.Yix76sfxrIlltSTJ]</h3><p>The Stolen Lands make ranger an excellent choice for Kingmaker, especially if the player wants to play a bounty hunter, ex-bandit, explorer, or survivalist.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.LO9STvskJemPkiAI]</h3><p>As with bards, rogues will find many opportunities to manipulate social encounters throughout the campaign. An ex-bandit or a bounty hunter might be a good choice for a rogue character, as would something like a spy or even a diplomat. All rogue rackets are sound choices for Kingmaker.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.15Yc1r6s9CEhSTMe]</h3><p>Kingmaker’s thematic ties to the First World make the fey and nymph bloodlines obvious choices for a sorcerer character. While any bloodline will have a chance to stand out, other bloodlines that have thematic ties to Kingmaker include draconic, elemental, and imperial.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.YtOm245r8GFSFYeD]</h3><p>Summoners of the Godcaller tradition are the most commonly encountered summoners in the region. The best choices, thematically, for a Kingmaker summoner’s eidolon include beast, dragon, fey, and plant.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.uJ5aCzlw34GGdWjp]</h3><p>Although swashbucklers are often portrayed as counterculture elements that make their names as rebels or oppositional forces to the government, swashbucklers can find plenty of opportunities to excel and stand out in Kingmaker. As long as a swashbuckler character supports the party’s kingdom, all swashbuckler styles are thematically appropriate.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.Y5GsHqzCzJlKka6x]</h3><p>Thaumaturges in the region are often misunderstood as investigators, wizards, or other scholars. All thaumaturge implements have use in this campaign, but your GM may have suggestions about specific choices that might mesh well with the game’s theme.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.bYDXk9HUMKOuym9h]</h3><p>Witches are quite appropriate for a Kingmaker campaign, particularly if they choose a thematically synergistic patron. Curse, fate, and wild are the most relevant choices.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.RwjIZzIxzPpUglnK]</h3><p>There are no specific arcane traditions of note in the Stolen Lands, making this an excellent opportunity for a wizard character to establish a school of their own in their kingdom.

The ability to track creatures is particularly useful in certain Kingmaker encounters. Social skills like Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation will be quite useful, particularly when the heroes are interacting with visitors or antagonists from neighboring realms. Strong choices for Lore specialties include Architecture, Banditry, Brevoy, Farming, First World, Fishing, Forest, Heraldry, Herbalism, Hills, Hunting, Iobaria, Labor, Mercantile, Mining, Mountains, Legal, Pitax, Plains, Politics, River, Scouting, Swamp, and Warfare. In addition, Lore skills focused on deities or types of creatures that play important roles in this campaign are excellent choices: Calistria, Cayden Cailean, Desna, Erastil, Gorum, Gozreh, and Shelyn are obvious choices for deity lore, along with Eldest Lore for knowledge of the pantheon of fey demigods; for creatures, the strongest thematic choices would include Boggard, Dragon, Fey, Kobold, Lizardfolk, and Troll Lore. If a player wants to choose a monster Lore, the GM should work with them to suggest options without spoiling too much.</p><h3>Archetypes</h3><p>All multiclass archetypes work well for a Kingmaker campaign. Other thematically appropriate archetypes from the Advanced Player’s Guide include archaeologist, assassin, beastmaster, bounty hunter, celebrity, herbalist, horizon walker, loremaster, marshal, scout, and snarecrafter. The Aldori Duelist archetype from the Pathfinder Lost Omens World Guide is an excellent thematic choice, as this campaign begins in Rostland, the home of this fighting style, and the PCs’ association with Jamandi Aldori is a great way to unlock access to this archetype.</p><h3>Building a Kingdom</h3><p>As the campaign progresses, players build their own kingdom, found settlements, and go to war with enemy nations. This Adventure Path’s rules for @UUID[.AkedyEf3bPMAT2RC], @UUID[JournalEntry.BIu4C1T1RR17QNwl], and @UUID[JournalEntry.TBY1Ir2GtQJqW8VD] should be provided to the players so that they can be familiar with them and reference them as needed during play.</p><h3>Languages</h3><p>Kingmaker takes place in the Stolen Lands, where Taldan is the most widespread language. Other strong choices for languages in Kingmaker include Aklo, Boggard, Cyclops, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnomish, Goblin, Hallit, Iruxi, Jotun, Necril, Sylvan.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>While you don’t start Kingmaker with a kingdom of your own, it won’t be long until your party receives a charter to found their own nation and begin to settle into the Stolen Lands. The @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7] journal contains non-spoiler information and rules for how to set up and run a kingdom of your own, and will hopefully be of use when it's time for your group to begin @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.HSLlW9iEZXiQzQpy]. In the meantime, though, it could be a good idea for the players and gamemaster to have a discussion about their plans, goals, and expectations. Below are some broad topics for the group to consider.</p><p><strong>Working Together</strong>: More so than typical Pathfinder campaigns, Kingmaker assumes that the PCs work together. These rules assume that all of the PCs have roles as leaders in the nation, and that they’re all focused on making their kingdom prosperous and stable, rather than stealing from the treasury, oppressing the citizens (or each other), or striking out on their own to start competing kingdoms. Before starting this campaign, you should make sure that everyone understands this assumption and builds appropriate characters.</p><p><strong>Leadership Roles</strong>: It could also be a good idea to consider the leadership roles as you create your party, as this will allow you to build characters for specific roles within a team. Remember, though these rules use the word “kingdom” to refer to the nation ruled by the PCs, the government doesn’t need to be a monarchy. Likewise, titles like “queen” or “king” may differ from the terms the PCs choose for their leaders (and in any case, gender has no mechanical role in the kingdom rules).</p><p><strong>Sharing the Load: </strong>Ruling a kingdom takes a lot of time, with the majority of actual game-play of running the kingdom taking place during downtime. These mechanics treat the kingdom itself as a sort of additional character in the party, so players who know how to navigate and level up their own characters should find managing a kingdom relatively straightforward. The GM and other players should work together to determine how best to keep track of their kingdom. Should the GM keep track of everything ? Should one player (perhaps the one in the Ruler @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.MWil0VWMcs66syY8]) always be responsible for filling out the kingdom sheet, while other players are responsible for different settlements ? Should the kingdom sheet pass from one player to the next each session or each time the kingdom levels up? There’s no one right answer, so use the solution that works best for your group.</p><p><strong>Kingdom in the Background</strong>: Not every group will be interested in the details of how a kingdom is built and managed. In such a case, the GM can allow the PCs’ kingdom to develop and grow in the background of the story. Resource encounters during hexploration become largely flavor discoveries in this case, and while you can still run Kingdom events as they occur during the campaign, their mechanical effects and repercussions should limit themselves to those that affect the PCs directly.</p><p><strong>Making Big Changes</strong>: In Kingmaker, a kingdom’s government type cannot be altered once chosen. Should the GM wish to allow a full regime change, it should cause significant events involving an adventure of its own, or at the very least should force the PC leaders to endure several Kingdom turns of anarchy. A full exploration of the story potential of regime changes are beyond the scope of these rules and of the Kingmaker Adventure Path. That said, if the PCs are seriously unhappy with a choice they made earlier regarding their kingdom’s government—or their sponsor or initial capital for that matter—the GM should consider simply letting the players retcon their choices and rebuild the kingdom with a new choice of government for the sake of keeping the campaign going!</p>"

The audio within these playlists primarily use assets provided by Owlcat Studios, for whom we are extremely grateful, and are augmented by audio assets from @UUID[JournalEntry.CVl4IXFSbmjCZ6fb.JournalEntryPage.swcgTlpn4FWgbqLe].</p><p>To achieve the best sound experience with your players, please configure the user volume controls at the top of the playlist tab to 50% volume, and adjust only those sliders if the volume is too quiet or too loud. All audio was mixed under the assumption that these sliders will be placed at 50%.</p><p>When preparing for your Kingmaker sessions, it is always beneficial to run through the audio playlists so that you have an understanding of the sound environment provided by each playlist you will use.</p><p>Playlists for Kingmaker primarily use the \"Simultaneous Playback\" option, allowing GMs to hit one button to play all of the audio for a particular area. It is recommended when the players transition from one area to another to check for a named playlist for the new area and simultaneously click play on one playlist while hitting stop on the current playlist (there is a 6 second fade in/fade out on each playlist), this should provide a smooth, cross-fading audio experience for your players.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header><h4>Playlist Organization</h4></header><p>In order to make the playlists easier to follow, each playlist has been titled to match the journal entry it is intended to correspond to. The only exception to this rule is cases where a combat encounter with a major NPC is 'optional' or where there is a story event which takes place in the same location before the combat occurs— playlists which only have the name of the NPC or encounter are intended to be used for the combat or dramatic event.</p><p>For example, @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR] begins with @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR.JournalEntryPage.bARm1CFX7iVxAKDr] journal entry, and its accompanying playlist @UUID[Playlist.r1c45gZoJEa3Msiz] should be played when introducing the players as the feast begins at the opening of the game.</p><header><h4>Stings and Themes</h4></header><p>The audio design for Kingmaker includes separate playlists for Stings and Themes.</p><p><strong>Stings</strong> are short (~30s) music clips designed to provide small musical prompts to the players that something important has occurred related to a particular NPC, Plotline, or Event. You might play @UUID[Playlist.KBHapDWEEaAhEMvf.PlaylistSound.0UoFa7rmk1l83jwI] when the players first encounter her or something she has done as part of the adventure's plot. Or use @UUID[Playlist.KBHapDWEEaAhEMvf.PlaylistSound.BCoab0Zb0Bn6mLsA] to hint that something relates to Tartuccio's underhanded actions.</p><p>We have also included a number of stings for battles and events to accent player victories and accomplishments.</p><p><strong>Themes</strong> are longer, seamlessly looping, musical pieces which are intended to be used during dramatic events. The goal of the themes playlist is to allow GMs to hint to players that there is some involvement of a particular faction, dramatic event, or major NPC. In addition, a number of themes are included to be used during scenes that should have a particular emotion.</p><p>For example, if your party has encountered an NPC they shouldn't take too seriously, you might play @UUID[Playlist.J38Fr6oATUjitviT.PlaylistSound.8hF0fkR9CUEg8nbH] or @UUID[Playlist.J38Fr6oATUjitviT.PlaylistSound.xsEk3JygPi9GcW0w]. While if your players have been doing well leading their kingdom in a positive, friendly, kind direction you might reward them during a round of Kingdom Management with @UUID[Playlist.J38Fr6oATUjitviT.PlaylistSound.iF5T9MO5TsCuKGRf] .</p><header><h4>Soundboards</h4></header><p>We have included a number of soundboard-only playlists which contain an array of sound effects intended to be triggered at GM discretion to enhance the sound environments of a scene or event. The purpose of these sounds and soundboards should be self explanatory based on the name of each sound.</p><p>For example, the Environmental Loops playlist can be leveraged by a GM to add weather sounds to an existing scene's playlist. If the players are visiting one of their lumber camps, you might enhance the scene by playing @UUID[Playlist.f8WaMOSx9YWW5szP.PlaylistSound.cp2paSPWJjpBmN8r]. If the weather turns foul while they are making camp for the night, you might play @UUID[Playlist.f8WaMOSx9YWW5szP.PlaylistSound.OyC9dJvfBB8CsaXA] to add to that feeling.</p><p></p></section>"

When the cult was confronted by worshippers of Pharasma eons ago, a desperate fight took place. With the aid of their own great hero Korog, Foras’s younger brother, the Pharasmins achieved initial success quickly in their attempt to defeat the Thresholders. Foras hadn’t shared his powers with everyone in the cult of Yog-Sothoth, so the unenlightened acolytes at the Thresholders’ lowest ranks couldn’t stand against the zealous onslaught of the furious Pharasmins. Soon, the entire tower of Candlemere was taken, and the Pharasmins used it as a base of operations while they turned their attentions to the chambers below.</p><p>In the basement, the Pharasmins’ advance was thwarted, for they hadn’t realized how powerful Foras’s inner circle of mystics and disciples were. After several failed attempts to progress into the chambers deep below Candlemere’s basement, Korog made the difficult choice to seal the cultists within rather than risk defeat at his older brother’s hands. The Pharasmins made a desperate push with their bravest fighters—including Korog—along with several allied psychopomps. As the Pharasmins penetrated the upper dungeon level, those behind them sealed the entrance to the dungeons shut with a magical ward on a stone plug. The Thresholders weren’t defeated, but they could menace the surface no longer.</p><p>But the Thresholders had ensured their immortality, and they could afford to simply wait out the Pharasmins that had established a beachhead in the upper dungeon. The Pharasmins trapped within the dungeon made a difficult (and, in their beliefs, blasphemous) choice to ensure their continued ability to hold the cultists at bay. Using forbidden lore gleaned from collections of tomes they’d seized in their final push, Korog convinced his fellow Pharasmins to undertake a ritual to end their lives and rise as eternal graveknights so they could stand between the Thresholders and the surface forever.</p><p>Korog knew he had to keep this secret from the psychopomps who had accompanied the Pharasmins—the grim and resolute monitors would consider embracing undeath to be treachery of the highest order. Korog therefore tricked the psychopomps into entering a stasis which has, by now, stretched into millennia.</p><p>The divisions between the dungeon chambers held by Korog and the Pharasmins and those held by the Thresholders are now well defined, and both are laden with traps and guardians. While this standoff has remained for thousands of years, the cultists have not been idle; they have continued their pursuit of esoteric rituals and are preparing to open a metaphysical portal to pull Yog-Sothoth into the Material Plane. This ritual isn’t close to completion, and as such the PCs have plenty of time to learn how to enter the dungeon and dispatch its ageless denizens—but if Foras and his cultists aren’t stopped, Yog-Sothoth’s arrival will not only free the cult back into the world, but will bring horror to the entire River Kingdoms as well.</p>"

This basement’s threats are geared toward a 4th-level party (see @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U.JournalEntryPage.FCJOgl9jjFQ02ecR] in Chapter 2 for details), but the Spiral Seal of Pharasma in area @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U.JournalEntryPage.IxWkClGQf2NWEnQL] of that level is powerful enough to block access beyond to 4th-level characters. While the encounters in this chapter are aimed at 16th-level PCs, the timing at which the characters return to Candlemere to explore its secrets is left open. The dungeons below Candlemere are in large part optional in the grand scheme of Kingmaker’s plot, so if the PCs manage to reach 18th level without exploring the dungeons presented here, they can proceed directly to @UUID[JournalEntry.geHtEMsUzqsld8cx].</p><p>Yet while the encounters in this chapter are largely apart from the campaign’s primary plot, PCs who explore this dungeon and defeat the cult that dwells within will gain a significant advantage once they reach Nyrissa’s stronghold at the end of the next chapter. Her fortress, the House at the Edge of Time, has a unique relationship with time itself, and if the PCs defeat Foras and master the strange rite that awaits them below Candlemere, their ability to endure the warped temporal effects within the House at the Edge of Time will increase significantly.</p><h2>Researching the Spiral Seal</h2><p>The PCs can begin researching the Spiral Seal as soon as they discover it, but initial attempts to do so may well meet with frustrating dead ends as lore about the Seal is difficult to find. Once they recover King Irovetti’s notes on the Spiral Seal, though, they’ll gain a much-needed boost to their research. If the PCs don’t discover these notes, and/or they don’t seem interested in returning to Candlemere (perhaps even as a result of having forgotten about the mysterious chambers below the tower on the isle), you could reintroduce the topic by having them hear rumors of an increasing number of lights swirling in the air above the ruins (these are more will-o’-wisps being drawn to the region as the power of the cult’s rituals grows deep below ground), or even be asked by a trusted NPC to investigate rumors of strange sounds or magical manifestations witnessed on the island lately.</p><p>In any event, the PCs can investigate the Spiral Seal using the Research rules as detailed on pages 154–155 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide. If the PCs have access to Irovetti’s notes, they gain a +4 item bonus on all @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.t5nBkpjroaq7QBGK] checks made to research the Spiral Seal.</p><section class=\"stats\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>Spiral Seal Research</h3><p>Library 16</p></header><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Occult</li></ul><p><strong>Regional Libraries</strong> Investigations pursued at a library in the PCs’ kingdom, or one in a neighboring city like Restov or Pitax; <strong>Maximum RP</strong> 5</p><p><strong>Research Checks</strong> @Check[type:library-lore|dc:33|traits:action:research] or @Check[type:pharasma-lore|dc:33|traits:action:research], @Check[type:occultism|dc:37|traits:action:research], @Check[type:religion|dc:35|traits:action:research]</p><hr /><p><strong>2 Research Points</strong> The PCs find that the Spiral Seal was created several thousand years ago by worshippers of Pharasma, and that it was intended to both physically and dimensionally seal off whatever chambers existed below.

Korog knew that the Spiral Seal would keep the cultists entombed, but rather than have faith in that magic or in the worshippers of Pharasma who remained on guard in the outer world, he ordered his followers to turn their backs on their beliefs to embrace undeath. As the PCs discover the undead Pharasmins and learn more about the nature of their decision, allow them to attempt a DC 30 Religion or DC 25 Pharasma Lore check to understand that Korog’s choice to become undead was blasphemous. A PC who uses this information against the undead Pharasmins gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidation checks to Demoralize the undead and to the DCs of any emotion-based effects used against the undead, at the GM’s discretion.</p></aside><p>The chambers of Candlemere’s upper dungeon are the site of a centuries-long stalemate between the Thresholders and the Pharasmins who wish to keep the cultists imprisoned. There were once three passages connecting the areas controlled by the Pharasmins (areas @UUID[.eOBzWEaBZoUn6YqW]–@UUID[.a6CPQ3ZvcruRxClE]) and the cultists (areas @UUID[.qTHenGfk0sDOKexj]–@UUID[.YDka3Bsn8Byl9TIL]), but one of these passages has collapsed, one is defended by a banshee loyal to neither side, and the other bears a trap the Pharasmins put in place long ago.</p><h2>Dungeon Features</h2><p>While the Spiral Seal is in place, the entirety of the Candlemere dungeon is shrouded in a powerful magical aura that prevents almost all travel in and out of the dungeon by any means, especially via teleportation effects, but also including any attempt to tunnel physically out of the complex (the one exception involves entry via dreams, but even then only one way; see @UUID[.1Rmw90xtZtr9juLf] for more information). Once the Spiral Seal is removed, these limitations vanish, but, apart from the stone disappearing and thus granting the PCs access to the chambers below, there are no physical or spiritual cues that anything has changed. Unless the occupants witness the PCs using previously impossible actions, it’ll likely be months or even years before they discover that the Seal has been lifted, as centuries of waiting have lulled them into lassitude. Once they do notice, they may (at the GM’s discretion) begin tentative explorations into the world beyond.</p><p>Both levels of the Candlemere dungeon are carved from natural stone. Smaller stones the size of bricks are cunningly fit together to smooth out the walls and floors, while the ceilings are bare stone; only a few indicated areas are natural caverns. The paper-thin gaps between these smaller stones emit a pale glow that suffuses the dungeon with light from the walls and floor. This light has no apparent source; if the bricks are pulled out to expose the natural stone, the glow ceases. Natural caverns are dark. Unless indicated otherwise, halls throughout the dungeon are 10 feet high, while chambers are 20 feet high. The doors are all made of heavy stone that grind closed when not held open, but none bear locks or bars.</p><p>If the PCs haven’t disabled the Dread Aura that infuses Candlemere (see @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U.JournalEntryPage.XbG1SuNFeOJbNo96] in Chapter 2 for details), those effects continue to persist down into these dungeons.</p>"

While the armor looks ancient and in poor condition, the supernatural effects of his presence as a graveknight keeps the armor functioning perfectly.

These graveknights all fight until destroyed. If Korog’s armor restores him, he does his best to ascertain the status of the Thresholders and return to his principal task of keeping them contained. Korog lacks the magic to restore the Spiral Seal, but he might work to physically block the passages out by collapsing the stone construction.

In the center of the spiral is a ritual chamber where the cult leader, Foras, works tirelessly at his rituals.</p><p>But Foras and his cultists aren’t alone in their endeavor. In the months before the clash with the Pharasmins, Foras reached out to the windswept plateau of Leng, for allies. A group of powerful denizens of Leng answered by sending a delegation of inhuman envoys to aid them, only to become trapped in the dungeon when the Spiral Seal cut off dimensional travel. In that time, the denizens have managed to breach the Spiral Seal only a few times to conjure potent agents from the depths of time itself, but even these powerful hounds of Tindalos found themselves unable to exit the dungeon as long as the Spiral Seal remained.</p><p>Fortunately for the cultists, the denizens of Leng are inhumanly patient, and they have been content to merely wait out the Spiral Seal. They’ve taken over the eastern rooms in the lower dungeon, and the cultists are happy to let them have those rooms while they continue to pursue their own goals.</p><h2>The Helix Theorem</h2><p>Although the PCs can prevent the Thresholders from finishing their patient endeavor in engineering Yog-Sothoth’s arrival on Golarion by simply killing them all and destroying their work, the very structure of the Spiral of Yog-Sothoth will continue to draw the Outer God’s gaze as long as it remains. Merely knocking over a few walls or blocking a few passages can’t undo the mystical effect the Spiral has imbued the region with; it has existed for so long that its shape is burned into the fabric of reality and the risk of catching Yog-Sothoth’s attention will remain until someone takes specific action to reverse this condition. A PC who has explored the Spiral and succeeds at a @Check[type:occultism|dc:35] or @Check[type:yog-sothoth-lore|dc:33] check realizes the metaphysical danger the lower dungeon poses.</p><p>To render the Spiral of Yog-Sothoth entirely harmless, the PCs must discover and perform a mystic rite called the <em>Helix Theorem</em>. The PCs can first learn about this ritual by examining the slate board in area @UUID[.qTHenGfk0sDOKexj], with further information awaiting discovery in area @UUID[.HXLgL6p5oCes0uP9]. In brief, the ritual requires closing a miniature gate icon nine times: once each in areas @UUID[.gzexduw0lqmG4q5r], @UUID[.HXLgL6p5oCes0uP9], @UUID[.Lax7DSMrgnvjmcyh], @UUID[.0kSqo5oKQtD59pcX], @UUID[.Zh2VM1v7YxAL43Qu], @UUID[.RVeE7HUPof17hEZy], @UUID[.nsM73V8Ra1IvLs24], @UUID[.Y0yPoSJNmiTvJA53], and @UUID[.XYXHryE1sVjrLhUw], in that order. Each time the gate is closed as part of the correct sequence, the icon itself glows with a soothing pale blue light until it is opened again (likely to perform the next closing). If the gate is closed out of sequence, the pale blue light flashes brightly before extinguishing, and the process must be started from the beginning.</p><p>The tiny gate must be a specially prepared icon representing the cosmic seal that serves as a boundary between Yog-Sothoth and the Material Plane. The miniature gate in area @UUID[.gzexduw0lqmG4q5r] works well for this purpose, although the PCs can prepare their own icon with success on a @Check[type:crafting|dc:38] check. Each time the gate is shut in one of these rooms, the PC performing the ritual must succeed at a @Check[type:occultism|dc:36] check. Other PCs can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.HCl3pzVefiv9ZKQW] this check as usual by intoning chants or simply helping to carry the gate. If any of these Occultism checks is failed, the PCs must start again in area @UUID[.gzexduw0lqmG4q5r]. At the conclusion of the ritual, the miniature gate must be placed—still closed—in the alcove in area @UUID[.XYXHryE1sVjrLhUw] at the very end of the spiral. When the <em>Helix Theorem</em> is successfully performed, the rooms in the lower dungeon twist and flex, shifting through the earth until they all exist along a straight line, rather than a curving spiral. This movement is unnerving but harmless to those in the rooms. The rooms thereafter can’t capture Yog-Sothoth’s attention or open the way for Yog-Sothoth to enter the Material Plane.</p><p>While this certainly prevents a potential disaster from destroying the PCs’ kingdom, performing the Helix Theorem here has an unanticipated side effect that the PCs won’t realize until some time later—by performing this rite, they inadvertently bolster their own presence in the flow of time. Any PC who was present below Candlemere when the <em>Helix Theorem</em> is performed gain additional protections once they reach Nyrissa’s @UUID[JournalEntry.GciDhpLFRov9s5Fm.JournalEntryPage.R1rWIW926cn6NfhY].</p><p>If the PCs don’t realize the danger posed by the Spiral or fail to perform the Helix Theorem, the long-term effects are up to the GM. Eventually, the Spiral draws other prospective cultists into the chambers; these cultists arrive singly or in small groups but quickly join together to continue the work the Thresholders began. These new cultists might be more powerful or more numerous than those the PCs previously destroyed. The spiral may even draw Yog-Sothoth’s dire gaze, causing spheres of eldritch power to erupt in the region and then begin to pull this part of the Material Plane out of phase with the rest of reality, exacerbating the dangers of the blooms that afflict the PCs’ kingdom at the start of Sound of a Thousand Screams.</p><section class=\"milestone\"><p><strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs successfully complete the <em>Helix Theorem</em> ritual, award them 120 XP.</p></section>"

Of course, when the heroes’ time comes, they still pass on to the River of Souls—Pharasma’s boon does not offer immortality, only a slight reprieve of the aches and pains along the way.</p><p>On the other hand, if the PCs didn’t complete the <em>Helix Theorem</em>, they might face further dangers from the ominous spiral beneath the Stolen Lands, and in time, another cult may arrive to take advantage of the site’s eldritch nature.

If the PCs aren’t quite high enough level to withstand the dangers that they’ll face as Kingmaker’s endgame begins in the next chapter, consider having them face additional perils as Yog-Sothoth’s influence spreads throughout their kingdom, be it in the form of additional dangerous Kingdom events or in the shape of new adventures of your own design.</p>"

Though marred by strife with neighboring nations, and even suffering some scars from a brief but brutal civil war, Pitax always stood as a sanctuary of sorts at the edge of the Stolen Lands. With the arrival of just one man only six years ago, however, this legacy changed. As the bandit king Castruccio Irovetti took control of Pitax, the city began to mirror his dark and brutal personality, becoming a force to be reckoned with in the River Kingdoms and drawing the ire and envy of the lands surrounding it.</p><p>By far, the most startling change made to Pitax by the decree of Irovetti has been his ham-fisted attempt to focus upon the fine arts. Determined to make Pitax a center of genteel refinement and culture, Irovetti ordered the construction of the Red Crescent theater, which became the cornerstone of other revitalized parts of Pitax. The city grew, attracting many actors, musicians, and other artists, causing the city’s coffers to swell with fresh gold. But by bringing in so many new souls, Pitax suddenly found a sinister, unsavory element becoming a part of its very core.</p><p>The presence of so many bards and storytellers from so many places has made the city a haven for secrets, rumors, tall tales, and occasionally even the truth. If one seeks information that might be little more than whispers and dust, Pitax might be the place to unearth clues. What sages don’t know, Pitax often does. The only trick to finding rare secrets in Pitax—secrets that could possibly lead to treasures or dooms beyond imagination—is knowing where to look.</p><p>That, and perhaps living long enough to escape with these secrets.</p>"

These sources suggest that once Pitax’s field armies are defeated and Avinash’s forces are routed, King Irovetti’s bravado will falter. At the same time, clandestine infiltrations into Pitax to destabilize his support from within can strike a devastating blow to Irovetti’s plans. Through a combination of defeating his field armies and turning factions within the city against him, the PCs can break the morale of the Pitaxian army and force King Irovetti to retreat into his palace, whereupon he’ll be cornered. These allies point to Irovetti’s legendary stubbornness as another great disadvantage, for he won’t consider fleeing “his” kingdom as long as the chance to defeat the PCs exists.</p><h2>Liberation Activities</h2><p>Pitax is a nation united under a competent and canny leader. Irovetti’s people may not love him, and his eccentricities regarding the arts frustrate and bewilder many, but they’d rather have him on their side than against them... at least until his bold and daring war of conquest threatens to bankrupt the kingdom and bring it from prosperity to ruin.</p><p>If the PCs wish to preserve the city, respect its citizens, and potentially set themselves up as saviors instead of proving that they’re the warmongers Irovetti’s propaganda portrays them as, they’ll need to pursue more subtle tactics than throwing armies against the city walls. They can pursue this goal using Liberation activities. Doing so awards Liberation Points (or penalizes them in the case of failures). Liberation Points can also be gained or (more often) lost through other developments, as summarized in Liberation Point Adjustments below.</p><p>Liberation activities play out in Exploration mode. Unless otherwise specified, a Liberation activity takes 3 hours to resolve, so during a typical day (which assumes the PCs spend 8 hours resting, 1 hour taking daily preparations, and 3 hours eating, relaxing, and potentially performing other exploration activities) a PC can attempt four Liberation activities.</p><aside class=\"right\"><h3>Liberation Point Adjustments</h3><p>Each time one of the following events occurs, adjust the PCs’ current Liberation Point (LP) total as indicated.</p><p><strong>The PCs slay a Pitax civilian</strong>: –5 LP</p><p><strong>One of Pitax’s field armies is defeated</strong>: +2 LP</p><p><strong>One of Pitax’s field armies wins a battle</strong>: –2 LP</p><p><strong>The PCs cause public destruction in Pitax</strong>: –1 to –5 LP (varies, with examples including –1 for minor vandalism or –5 for destroying a building)</p><p><strong>The PCs do not Lie Low after an encounter with a Warden patrol</strong>: –1d4+2 LP</p><p><strong>The PCs attack Pitax with an army</strong>: LP can no longer be gained for 1 month</p></aside><p>The primary way in which the PCs earn Liberation Points is by discovering and pursuing opportunities keyed to specific locations in Pitax. A PC can certainly discover a location’s liberation activities by stumbling on the location and asking the right questions, but it’s perhaps more efficient for a PC to use the Seek Opportunity activity instead to learn about these specific opportunities.</p><p><strong>Initial Liberation Points</strong>: If the PCs won the Rushlight Tournament, their fame precedes them and they begin with 6 Liberation Points. If they made second place, they start with 3 Liberation Points. Otherwise, they start with 1 Liberation Point. Add 2 Liberation points for each battle the PCs have won against any of Pitax’s field armies, and subtract 2 for each such battle lost.</p><p><strong>30+ Liberation Points</strong>: Once the PCs accumulate at least 30 Liberation Points, the atmosphere on Pitax’s streets grows very decidedly anti-Irovetti. As long as the PCs’ Liberation Point total remains at 30 or higher, no Warden patrols are encountered on the streets of Pitax, and the number of guards and defenses present at the palace is reduced as detailed in Part 5. Once Irovetti is defeated, it will be much easier for the PCs to bring Pitax into their kingdom if they have at least 30 Liberation Points (see the end of this chapter).</p><p><strong>0 Liberation Points</strong>: Liberation Points can’t be reduced below 0. As long as the PCs are at 0 Liberation Points, they suffer a –4 status penalty on all checks made to resolve Liberation activities. If something would normally cause Liberation Points to go below 0, the PCs are instead confronted by two Warden patrols (a Severe 14 encounter) or increase the status penalty to Liberation checks to –4 for the next 24 hours (GM’s choice). If the PCs are at 0 Liberation Points in their quest to free Pitax when a Kingdom turn begins, enough volunteers join the Pitaxian army that a new @UUID[JournalEntry.yGGSDRma9yTWwdeo.JournalEntryPage.3qLrv7twWmOnexiT] field army encamps in a hex of the GM’s choice along the border of the PCs’ kingdom.</p>"

The violence between Pitax and Corvenn culminated in an incident known as the Deafening Flames, when rebels from Corvenn torched the southern wall of Pitax and razed the southern half of the city. Though Corvenn and Pitax eventually resolved their differences and merged back into a single River Kingdom, the damage was done. The southern half of Pitax lay in ruin for decades, just a pile of rubble and lingering ashes.</p><p>Recent additions to the entire city can be found in the form of statues, particularly gargoyles. Commissioned by Irovetti himself to mimic the historic pomp of aged southern cities, most of these statues are disgusting or crude works of monsters or human figures—sometimes both. Many of the gargoyles that sit ominously atop rooftops in Pitax—especially those closest to the palace where Irovetti resides—are works of genuine quality, but over the past few years, more sloppy and crude efforts have spread across Pitax like a disease.</p><p>The wharfside of <strong>Troutmouth</strong> is a strange mix of hardworking warehouse workers living with their families and freebooting sailors who drift in and out of the city with their ships. Though this often leads to loud and boisterous conflicts between the two groups in the wee hours of the morning, both the workers and the sailors share a grudging respect for one another. The two groups are unified by a shared loathing for the Bandit Houses, which they believe to be rich, selfish, and indifferent to their problems. Wooden warehouses standing amid smaller wooden buildings line the docks of Troutmouth. Of these smaller buildings, most are old and weatherworn, with even the newer buildings bearing obvious water damage from the Pitax River’s occasional floods. Muddy roads crisscross their way through Troutmouth, but these slowly give way to cobblestone streets as they finally enter the Shattered Ward and the heart of Pitax.</p><p>Long the spiritual heart of Pitax, the <strong>Shattered Ward</strong> grew from the remnants of the bandit keep built during the city’s earliest days. This is where most merchants and travelers conduct their business. Its streets are the busiest, its buildings the largest, and its shadows the most likely to hide secrets and dangers. Large buildings made of dark limestone, some several stories in height, rise throughout this area, surrounding the Common Square like stones ringing a campfire. A large wall known as the Inner Fortress, made from limestone of a lighter hue, runs along the southern border of the Shattered Ward.</p><p>Old and new gates alike lead from that wall into the <strong>New Ruins</strong>, the part of Pitax that was once overrun and destroyed during the city’s bloody civil war a century earlier. New stone roads and small stone buildings, built from the remains of the great towers that once stood proudly over the city in earlier days, stand amid the genuine ruins in this partially rebuilt sector. When Irovetti ascended to power, he proceeded to take ownership of this area that had long lain fallow, and he began rebuilding it according to his own garish tastes. The Red Crescent Theater and the Academy of Grand Arts became the heart of the revitalized west end of Pitax. Though both were built ostensibly for the purpose of making Pitax a haven for fine art, Irovetti had a shrewder purpose in mind: attracting builders, artists, and merchants, and, by extension, more money. The New Ruins now presents a half-realized appearance, with the sculpted stone facades of buildings along the Inner Fortress turning to carved wood and eventually to plain timber near the edge of town. At its farthest reaches, public funding and interest waned, leaving several blocks of aging rubble and dangerous, burnt-out frames available for whatever squatters or dangerous creatures dare to claim them.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>Warden Patrols</h3><p>Low 14</p></header><p>Trios of Pitax Wardens patrol the city streets, and they confront the PCs if they notice them. Generally, such a confrontation occurs only when the PCs fail or critically fail at certain Liberation activities, but at your option (such as if the PCs make an extremely public appearance), they are confronted by a Warden patrol that attacks them at once. If characters wish to escape the Warden patrol, you can have them attempt an Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, or Stealth check against the Pitax Wardens’ Reflex DC to see if they can get away, with a failure resulting in a fight. Once an encounter with a Warden patrol finishes, if the PCs don’t use their next Exploration activity to Lie Low, they lose 1d4+2 Liberation Points as a result of increased patrols spreading fear through the populace.</p></section><h3>City Walls</h3><p>Pitax’s stone city walls are strong and sturdy, oft repaired and enhanced—particularly over the past year as Irovetti has had increasing convictions that his city should be more fortified. The walls themselves offer few handholds—it’s a @Check[type:athletics|dc:30|traits:action:climb] check to Climb them—but their primary purpose is to provide numerous points of fortification for a wide range of ballistae, catapults, and other siege engines. The king makes sure to keep these well-attended, ensuring that any attempt to take Pitax by force will pay dearly for the attempt.</p>"

However, although no expense was spared to construct several new buildings for the academy, Irovetti proved notoriously cheap when it came to attracting skilled teachers of the various arts. Unable to tell the difference between good art and bad, and generally preferring bad anyway, Irovetti recruited a faculty of failed artists, has-beens, and never-weres, most deluded into believing themselves unrecognized geniuses rather than mere hacks. Bad teachers begat bad students, so combined with Irovetti’s heavy-handed control over the art projects in Pitax, the academy bears a reputation for producing publicly funded affronts to good taste.</p><p>Fortunately, Headmistress Gitaren—who does have genuine talent and a wonderful singing voice—manages to rise above much of this. In the small hours of the morning, the few talented students and teachers attending the academy put their skills to work, creating marvelous works of art that remain, for the most part, unseen by the rest of Pitax.

                            "text": "<p>On the surface, Irovetti rules Pitax, but a deeper look into the city’s political landscape reveals a more complex situation. Before Irovetti’s arrival, eight factions held different degrees of influence over the city. Some of them supported Pitax’s rulers while others opposed them, and this hasn’t changed with the new rule, although the factions tread carefully in how they interact with Irovetti—he has already proven to some of them that he has the temperament and the power to break them if they cross him.</p><p>Each of these eight factions traditionally identifies itself with specific colors, symbols, and types of clothing.</p><table><caption>Factions of Pitax</caption><thead><tr><th>Faction</th><th>Type</th><th>Color</th><th>Symbol</th><th>Clothing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Calistrians</td><td>Faith</td><td>Black, yellow</td><td>Three daggers</td><td>Religious raiment</td></tr><tr><td>Cattanei Family</td><td>Bandit House</td><td>Green</td><td>Coiled snake</td><td>Black vest with green thread</td></tr><tr><td>Dealers of Pitax</td><td>Criminals</td><td>Gray</td><td>Two X marks</td><td>Long coat with hidden pouches</td></tr><tr><td>Desnans</td><td>Faith</td><td>Blue, white</td><td>Butterfly</td><td>Religious raiment</td></tr><tr><td>Liacenza Family</td><td>Bandit House</td><td>Dark red</td><td>Fox’s head</td><td>Left glove with a dark red mark</td></tr><tr><td>Red Crescent Troupe</td><td>Entertainers</td><td>Red, black</td><td>Crescent</td><td>Gaudy, blue and purple outfits</td></tr><tr><td>Strocalle Family</td><td>Bandit House</td><td>Purple</td><td>Cracked coin</td><td>Long sash attached to belt</td></tr><tr><td>Vascari Family</td><td>Bandit House</td><td>Light blue</td><td>Blue heron</td><td>Blue tabard with large collar</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Bandit Houses</h3><p>Long ago, a group of bandits fleeing reprisal in Brevoy founded the safehold that would become Pitax. Their leader became the patriarch of the <strong>Cattanei</strong> family, esteemed residents who ruled over Pitax during the early centuries of its existence. Descendants of the other original bandits also formed three other influential families: the <strong>Liacenzas</strong>, the <strong>Vascaris</strong>, and the <strong>Strocalles</strong>. And while today these four families operate more as merchant cartels than criminals, tradition has kept their label as the Bandit Houses of Pitax. Today, three of the four Bandit Houses own and control their own warehouses, which serve as their means of conducting business. The fourth family, the Liacenzas, recently lost control of their Trade House to Irovetti, but for the time being, they retain enough influence in town to remain an important faction.</p><h3>Dealers of Pitax</h3><p>The main rival to the Bandit Houses is a loose coalition of despicable merchants, drug dealers, and criminals who seek to win fortune for themselves at the expense of Pitax’s honest traders. Pitax’s criminal underground wields formidable influence in the city, and with the arrival of Irovetti, their power—and ambition—grows daily. These criminals are referred to collectively as the <strong>Dealers of Pitax</strong>, and increasingly, a gnome man named Kharne Vereel serves as the one they look to for leadership. Kharne and his favored agents can be found at the Rose Tower (see area @UUID[.0EPrUfA3F2lGsRMl]).</p><h3>Pitax’s Churches</h3><p>While Pitax itself isn’t a particularly religious city, two churches in particular have widespread favor. The <strong>church of Calistria</strong> (see area @UUID[.StHWCPlKnLVgdItW]) is the more powerful, as it represents the oldest religious tradition in the area. The <strong>church of Desna</strong> (see area @UUID[.czIYU0reyL4kAEby]) is relatively new, having arrived in Pitax only a year before Irovetti himself. Neither church is particularly fond of Irovetti, but each has their reasons for not taking a harder stance against him. One would perhaps expect a temple of Shelyn in a town purportedly devoted to the arts, but the city’s general attitude ironically makes it an unwelcoming place for this faith.</p><h3>The Red Crescent Troupe</h3><p>The newest notable faction in Pitax are the actors, directors, and playwrights of the <strong>Red Crescent Troupe</strong>. Irovetti won them over by financing a theater named after them, and as such the performers have felt indebted to him from the start. In the early years of Irovetti’s rule, the Red Crescent was among the city’s largest draws, but the troupe is now on the edge of an internal schism as those who look to rebel against Irovetti clash against those who fear losing everything they’ve built up over the years. This faction is based in the Red Crescent Theater (area @UUID[.IWafhPrsUGqxvrh4])</p>"

                            "text": "<p>Irovetti’s palace is one of the oldest buildings in the city, built by an eccentric wizard who had a strange fascination with doors, twisting mazes, and architectural whimsies. The baffling structure fits Irovetti’s needs well, and the tangle of halls and doors makes it an easy place to get lost in and an even easier place for its denizens to defend. The palace certainly earns its nickname—the “House of a Hundred Doors.” In fact, the palace has well over a hundred doors, many of them secret.</p><p><strong>Approaching the Palace</strong>: If the PCs haven’t accumulated at least 30 @UUID[.EiiVa70gDJOJ8N74], any approach to the Palace is potentially observed by the guards. Pitax Wardens are posted at the six watchtowers in the palace (see below), and during the day they’ll automatically notice the PCs approaching and raise the alarm unless they disguise themselves or use magic to provide some sort of cover (but if the magic is obvious, such as a sudden fog bank rolling in, the Wardens still notice it and raise the alarm). At night, the PCs can attempt a @Check[type:stealth|dc:32|traits:action:avoid-notice] check to approach the Palace undetected. If the alarm is raised, patrols within the Palace quickly move to ballista chambers to fire upon the PCs (see area @UUID[.4SoUzhH0XGCGMBN8] for details). If the PCs are at or above 30 Liberation Points, the guards have largely fled the Palace and the PCs can approach safely without needing to use Stealth.</p><p><strong>Walls</strong>: Despite the expansive size of the house, the palace has only one floor above ground. Its roofline is a complex tangle of slopes, domes, and pitches that barely seems to match the underlying layout of rooms and halls. The external walls and roof are comprised of two 1-foot-thick stone walls sandwiching two 3-inch-thick iron walls, which themselves sandwich a thin layer of lead sheeting—all of which has been enhanced to resist magical effects that target the walls themselves. The walls attempt to counteract any spell that targets them as a result (7th level, counteract +22). The exterior walls (Hardness 18, HP 70 [BT 35]) can be Climbed with a @Check[type:athletics|dc:30|traits:action:climb] check. The interior walls (Hardness 14, HP 56 [BT 28]) are of similar construction but half the width.</p><p><strong>Watchtowers</strong>: Most of the spiral stairs in the palace (with the notable exception of the flights found in areas @UUID[.F8t435Vd9XvitFQQ] and @UUID[.cZd4hZ5hZQnkoJiD]) lead up to small watchtowers on the palace roof above. As long as the PCs haven’t reached 30 Liberation Points, these rooftop watchtowers are each occupied by a Pitax Warden ready to raise the alarm if they see anyone attempting to enter the palace from above. Each rooftop watchtower is accessed via a trapdoor that can be locked and bolted. Opening a trapdoor requires three @Check[type:thievery|dc:34|traits:action:pick-a-lock] checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H] or a @Check[type:athletics|dc:36|traits:action:force-open] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SjmKHgI7a5Z9JzBx]—each door has its own unique key held by its accompanying guard. If the PCs have achieved 30 or more Liberation Points, the Wardens have abandoned their posts but left the doors locked.</p><p><strong>Other Palace Features</strong>: Most hallways and chambers in the palace have 18-foot ceilings, but several areas have even higher ceilings; these variations are mentioned in the text. Light inside the palace is provided by everburning torches in the grand hall and by common oil lamps elsewhere. In addition, most rooms possess slit windows or slitted skylights. These windows, rarely more than 1 foot wide, are of leaded crystal in narrow diamond-shaped panes between 1-inch-thick leaded steel bars (Hardness 20, HP 50, [BT 25]). The fireplace chimneys in the Great Hall and kitchens are blocked by similar grates without the glass. Unless otherwise noted, secret doors in the palace can be discovered with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:30|traits:action:search] check.</p><p><strong>Raised Alarms</strong>: Those infiltrating Irovetti’s palace must be very careful if they wish to avoid a general alarm. Once the alarm is raised, word spreads throughout the palace rapidly, and the alarm stays raised for 24 hours. In addition to the various guards listed at key locations, there are six roving bands of guards, each consisting of four Pitax Wardens. If the alarm is raised, two of these groups mobilize and move to investigate the source of the alarm, arriving in the area after [[/r 2d6]] rounds. In addition, as long as the alarm is raised, all of the palace’s defenders and inhabitants gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks.</p><p>If the PCs have achieved 30 Liberation Points, these six bands of guards have abandoned the palace, and a raised alarm only bolsters the Perception of those who remain behind in keyed areas.</p><h3>Unkeyed Rooms</h3><p>The majority of the rooms in Irovetti’s palace aren’t labeled on the map. These unkeyed rooms consist of two types: the 5-foot square rooms are privies containing a single toilet, and the 5-by-10-foot rooms are bedrooms for guards, servants, or guests (although Irovetti has currently dismissed all of his servants and his only guest—the weretiger Alasen—has her own larger room). Each of these unremarkable rooms contains a single bed, a nightstand, and a footlocker. The doors of these rooms can be latched from within but not locked. Unlatching a door from the other side requires a @Check[type:thievery|dc:25|traits:action:pick-a-lock] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H].</p><p>Some of these unkeyed rooms have been trapped by the guards in an attempt to slowly erode the resources of any intruders into the palace. Each time the PCs enter an unkeyed room, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:8] (or a @Check[type:flat|dc:16] if the PCs have achieved at least 30 Liberation Points). On a <strong>success</strong>, the room contains either a @UUID[Actor.KpBLGfDHPV71wj7e] (treat as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.mWXaROc9ytjdGVVP] snare that inflicts piercing damage) or a @UUID[Actor.o3zdn7YGpTuUfo0a] (treat as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.a2XaerM1KkPyLIPM] that raises the alarm if it’s triggered), with an equal chance of either. Keep track of the number of snares the PCs encounter—there are only a dozen of them in all in the Palace, so once the PCs reach this number of snares, no further snares will be encountered.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header><p>Rollable Tables</p><p>@UUID[RollTable.QQvTkNm85l4F6h9G], @UUID[RollTable.MVEQ4xAGnsw60O0F]</p></header><p>Use these tables to automatically resolve the flat check to determine the contents of an unkeyed room.

A PC who takes a few hours sorting through these pages can put together the king’s plans and goals as regards their kingdom, and you can use this resource to answer any lingering questions the players may have about Irovetti himself. Additionally, the notes can point the PCs toward any undiscovered points of interest in the Stolen Lands if you wish, as Irovetti’s scouts have been exploring and reporting on the area for years.</p><p>Of particular interest among these notes are those found in a slim, red leather folio. These notes, written in Aklo, document numerous points of research into “places of power” hidden within the Stolen Lands. A PC who takes an hour to research these notes discovers that Irovetti has been sending scouts and explorers out to investigate areas within the region where he suspects potent magic might be recovered to aid him in his fight against the PCs’ kingdom. You should tailor these locations to make it appear that Irovetti’s growing increasingly frustrated as sites he explores end up either disappointing them or are places the PCs have already explored during the campaign, but one site in particular should catch the PCs’ attention—the island of @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U.JournalEntryPage.FCJOgl9jjFQ02ecR].</p><p>Irovetti’s notes on Candlemere focus on initial reports that cite old rumors of a great treasure or a great danger—or perhaps both—having been sealed into a vault below a magical seal placed centuries ago by the priesthood of Pharasma. The reports from his field agents speak of encountering large numbers of will-o’-wisps on Candlemere, of an oppressive magical aura, and of an intriguing spiral seal found in an underground chamber below. If the PCs already explored Candlemere earlier in the campaign, they may well recognize some of these, but the extent to which Irovetti has started to research the spiral seal (including his hopes that he might make contact with a powerful ally potentially trapped below the seal that he could recruit against the PCs’ kingdom) should kindle curiosity about the site again. These notes can aid the PCs in researching the Spiral Seal, as detailed at the start of the next chapter.</p><p>One element that’s mostly absent from this collection, though, is Irovetti’s association with Nyrissa. He never mentions the nymph queen by name, and left only one brief, cryptic mention of <em>Briar</em> that the PCs should take note of, as the note is the only one that appears on the page: “The blade was hidden under Whiterose all this time—it’s safe now, but I don’t think I’ll be telling her about it yet.”</p></section>"

If he does manage to survive (either alone or with some of his allies), Irovetti still effectively abandons his role as king, and any of his remaining allies are quick to abandon the region or even beg for forgiveness from the PCs. In this case, you can either have Irovetti leave the region and never return or have him continue to plague the PCs from the wilderness as he attempts to recruit new allies. He might even find his way to Thousandbreaths and beg for aid from Nyrissa, in which case the nymph is likely to either imprison him in her domain or transform him into some sort of strange new monster to serve as a guardian.

All that remains of the city are five slabs of uprooted terrain that float in the air at different altitudes. Above, as below, the sky and ground have been replaced by what appear to be glowing panes of fiery glass within which these fragments of the PCs’ capital now lie suspended. After gazing out upon the strange horizon, success at a @Check[type:perception|dc:20] check is all that’s required to realize that it all seems to be housed in a single vast lantern, its glass panes inverted so that the flame that glows to provide illumination shines in from beyond. Characters who peer long enough into those distant glass panes may periodically catch glimpses of other entirely unknown worlds, each of which suffers in the fires of their own private apocalypse. These are windows into the other 999 kingdoms that were once contained in the <em>Apology</em>, but there is no way to reach these realities from within the Ravaged Capital itself.</p><aside class=\"right\"><h3>Where Is Nyrissa?</h3><p>If Nyrissa still lives, she too has been trapped within this demiplane, but—unlike the PCs, whom the Lantern King has placed where he can be entertained by them—Nyrissa is ensconced within a cage at the Lantern King’s side (see @UUID[.BX7f7hUaiYuBNSjn]). As the PCs explore the Lantern Kingdom, they periodically hear Nyrissa’s voice calling for help as if over a great distance from somewhere far above.</p></aside><p>The Lantern Kingdom is a small, finite demiplane encased entirely within a single lantern that hangs in the Lantern King’s throne room in the First World. As the PCs explore the Ravaged Capital, they occasionally catch glimpses beyond the distant glass borders of an immense burning sphere topped by a jagged crown of horns—the Lantern King watching from beyond as the PCs suffer and toil for his amusement. Divination magic can serve to reveal some of the truths of this realm to the PCs, as can speaking to the few friendly NPCs they encounter along the way. Alternately, a PC can take ten minutes Investigating the environment, after which they can attempt a @Check[type:arcana|dc:40|traits:action:investigate], @Check[type:nature|dc:40|traits:action:investigate], @Check[type:occultism|dc:40|traits:action:investigate], or @Check[type:religion|dc:40|traits:action:investigate] check. <strong>Success</strong> indicates they recognize they’re within a strange demiplane that seems to exist entirely within a single immense lantern, while a <strong>critical success</strong> confirms that it is the Lantern King who watches them from the far side of the demiplane’s glass borders.</p><h2>Arrival in the Lantern Kingdom</h2><p>Whether the Hunting Dream resulted in the Wild Hunt defeating the PCs or in the PCs being victorious, the dream’s end is the same—the Apology is shattered and the PCs black out, only to awaken in the Lantern Kingdom. The PCs may initially suspect they’ve simply moved from one dream to another, but as strange as the environment seems, it is very real. Success at a @Check[type:first-world-lore|dc:35|traits:action:recall-knowledge] or @Check[type:nature|dc:40|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo] identifies the realm as an unknown demiplane that lies between the First World and the Material Plane. A <strong>critical success</strong> suggests to the PC the high probability that this demiplane was constructed from metaphysical “echoes” of the kingdoms once contained within the <em>Apology</em> itself.</p><p>If the PCs survived the @UUID[.L8UvMkhoqamn3kBj], they waken from it refreshed and in perfect health, as if they’d had a full night’s rest and had just finished their daily preparations, as they were at the start of the Hunting Dream. The PCs arrive at area @UUID[.bUY4YHhEtaHpQHOX].</p><h2>Features of the Lantern Kingdom</h2><p>The Lantern Kingdom consists of five separate areas: island-like regions that are each based on a different part of the PCs’ capital city. The Lantern Kingdom as a whole serves as a sort of obstacle course the PCs must navigate, a testing ground created by the Lantern King for his amusement, with a chance to meet with him being the reward to PCs if they are clever, brave, or stubborn enough to make it to the end. As such, the PCs find that as long as they remain close to the ground on the floating islands within the Lantern Kingdom, they remain relatively safe, but any attempt to circumvent the course—or worse, approach the Kingdom’s glass borders—quickly reveals itself to be deadly; see Travel on the next page for details.</p><p>The Lantern Kingdom demiplane has the following unusual features.</p><p><strong>Size: </strong>The demiplane is finite in size. The lantern itself is 5 feet across where it hangs in the Lantern King’s realm on the First World, but it is much larger on the inside where the PCs have become trapped. The islands float near the center of the spherical orb, such that the glass borders are just about a mile from the edges of the islands themselves.</p><p><strong>Illumination</strong>: The Lantern Kingdom is brightly lit at all times, either by the surrounding glass borders or by glowing motes of light that hover near the ceiling of internal locations. This illumination resists the creation of magical darkness. One minute after a magical darkness effect is created, or at the end of a combat in which such an effect is created (whichever comes first), the Lantern Kingdom attempts to counteract the darkness effect ([[/r 1d20+40]] counteract check). If it fails to counteract the magical darkness, the Lantern Kingdom automatically attempts a new counteract check once every 24 hours (unless, of course, the darkness effect ends before then).</p><p><strong>Islands: </strong>The islands in the Lantern Kingdom float at different altitudes. The group of islands that constitute the Market (where the PCs first arrive in the Lantern Kingdom) is the lowest, with the Residence, the Nobles, the Park, and the Palace each 100 feet higher than the last. As such, it’s impossible to see much more than the basic shape of an island above, while one can look down to a bird’s-eye view of any island that lies below. The islands themselves are stable; though seemingly floating in the air, there is no sensation to those standing on them that they are on anything other than solid ground. In some places, small gaps in the landscape might force harrowing leaps over the void below. While you can build up some of the perceived dangers of doing so, unless the distance being jumped is more than 5 feet across you shouldn’t ask for Athletics checks to successfully navigate the gap. Characters who tumble through such a gap fall as detailed under “Falling” below.</p><p><strong>Travel: </strong>The streets of the ruined capital that lie upon the Lantern Kingdom’s islands are strewn with rubble and overgrown with strange First World plants. All ground travel is difficult terrain (from tangled undergrowth outside of buildings, and from rubble and debris inside of buildings) as a result. There are no restrictions on flight, provided the flying character doesn’t stray further than 60 feet from the ground. Any attempt to move further than 60 feet from the ground via flight (be it straight up or out from the edge of an island) results in a painful flash of searing light that inflicts [[/r 10d6[fire]]] damage (@Check[type:reflex|dc:40|basic:true] save) to the flying creature and prevents further movement in the prohibited direction—the Lantern King wants his entertainment to travel through the kingdom along the route he chose rather than to skip entire islands by flight. “North” in the Lantern Kingdom isn’t the result of a magnetic pull but the Lantern King’s will.</p><p><strong>Planar Travel: </strong>It’s possible for a PC to escape the Lantern Kingdom via planar travel through effects like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ] or being sent away by spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.bay4AfSu2iIozNNW]. Deliberate travel to the Lantern Kingdom is possible via @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ] (provided the PCs can secure the incredibly rare tuning fork for this, which is subject to GM approval) or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.U13bC0tNgrlHoeTK], but as long as the Lantern King hasn’t been successfully challenged in his @UUID[.BX7f7hUaiYuBNSjn], any PC who escapes the Lantern Kingdom returns the next time they fall asleep or lose consciousness. Regardless of how a PC travels to the Lantern Kingdom, they always appear in area @UUID[.bUY4YHhEtaHpQHOX].</p><p><strong>Falling: </strong>It’s possible to fall from the edge of an island, but one who falls never lands where logic would dictate. A character who falls plummets 100 feet and lands on the next lower island at its lowest-numbered encounter area, regardless of where the fall began, and even if that area is inside of a structure. A character who falls from the Market instead falls 200 feet before landing at area A1.</p><p><strong>Creatures: </strong>Just as the Lantern Kingdom’s geography is based on the PCs’ capital, some of its “citizens” are warped duplicates of NPCs from home—some appearing as old enemies, and some as friends. For the latter, choose living NPCs who have leadership roles in the PCs’ kingdom or other trusted allies, excluding any who have accompanied the PCs into the Lantern Kingdom. If you’re using the Kingmaker Companion Guide, any of the companions in that book who remained behind on the Material Plane make great choices.</p><p><strong>Resting: </strong>The Lantern King allows the PCs to rest on any one island once, out of “fairness” to keep the entertainment going. If the PCs attempt to rest on the same island more than once, they’ll be attacked at some point during the rest by a group of four @UUID[Actor.fQ9FuovHuRt6vtcq] (a Moderate 20 encounter) who haughtily warn the PCs to not dawdle—to “keep moving or suffer.” If the PCs refuse, they must defeat the wild hunt, after which they earn the chance for the additional rest. Each additional rest on that island adds one wild hunt scout to the resulting encounter, to a maximum of a dozen scouts (an Extreme 20 encounter). There are enough constantly blooming fruits and berries among the foliage overgrowing the shattered city, along with small pools of water here and there that refill magically over time, so that PCs who are trapped for many days in the Lantern Kingdom can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.49y9Ec4bDii8pcD3] with a @Check[type:survival|dc:35|traits:action:subsist] check.

Fortunately for the PCs, they won’t need to face him in person; the Lantern King has created a manifestation of his power within this room, an avatar of sorts, through whom he looks forward to speaking to the PCs. Initially, he appears in the form of a handsome, slender fey man with pointed ears and crown-like horns on his head. His armor and weapons evoke themes of a lit, glowing lantern, but all of this is merely for show; if a fight begins, he assumes his natural form—that of a 25-foot-diameter sphere of fire and light surrounded by twisting magical runes.</p><p>The Lantern King irreverently sits on one of the melted thrones, waiting for the PCs to arrive. He is attended by a number of fetch stalkers, each of whom has the form of one of the PCs (as such, the number of fetch stalkers in attendance should equal the number of PCs in the encounter). These fetch stalkers kneel to either side of the throne, obviously submissive to the Lantern King in mockery of the PCs themselves.</p><p>If Werendegar escorts the PCs, he takes his time introducing each of them to the Lantern King. You should take the time to call out two significant accomplishments for each PC at this time, making it seem almost like Werendegar is bragging about the PCs to the Lantern King, but once he has completed his introductions, he turns to the PCs and says “Yet despite your accomplishments, you are but ashes before the glory of a god,” before introducing the Lantern King himself. Werendegar then steps forward to take a silent position at the Lantern King’s side.</p><p>The Lantern King is frustrated that the PCs have disrupted the long, complex torments he’d put in place for Nyrissa, but a part of him has to admit that watching them grow in power and succeed against the nymph queen has been almost as entertaining. He hopes to draw some final fun from the PCs in this encounter, and perhaps even recruit them as his agents.</p></section><p>This encounter resolves over the course of three different stages—Introductions, Apologies, and Invitations. During each of these stages, the PCs interact with the Lantern King by attempting different skill checks to build up Victory Points to determine the final outcome of this climactic resolution to the Kingmaker Adventure Path. The PCs are free to throw caution to the wind and attack the Lantern King at any point, but if they do so before completing the three stages, they’ll face a much more dangerous fight. The Lantern King subtly encourages the PCs to lose their temper in the way he addresses them, hoping for a chance to test his avatar’s mettle against the heroes of the Stolen Lands.</p><p>In each of the three stages, each PC has a chance to attempt a single skill check to build up their total number of Victory Points. The amount of points they earn for each check follows this default scale:</p><ul class=\"outcomes\"><li><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The PCs gain 2 Victory Points.</p></li><li><p><strong>Success</strong> The PCs gain 1 Victory Point.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The PCs lose 1 Victory Point.</p></li></ul><h2>INTRODUCTIONS</h2><p>Even if Werendegar escorted them into the throne room, the Lantern King is eager to hear from the PCs themselves about who they are and why they have come before him. He starts this stage with the following comment and challenge.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>“You come before me as heroes of your world, yet you are still children before me. Tell me, each of you, what great deed have you accomplished that would suggest that my time is worth being spent entertaining you?”</p></section><p>At this point, each of the PCs has a chance to boast about what they feel is their greatest deed throughout the course of this campaign. Each can choose any skill of their choice to perform this boast, provided they justify its use. Since the skills used in the next two stages are specific ones, this is a chance for characters with other specialties to shine. Once all of the PCs have boasted, the Lantern King claps slowly in an almost mocking way, then goes on to claim responsibility for the PCs’ triumphs. After all, had he not set these events in motion by exiling Nyrissa, the PCs themselves would have had no “grand adventure” to become the heroes of.</p><p>Regardless of the skill chosen, it’s a DC 42 check to earn Victory Points.</p><h2>APOLOGIES</h2><p>The second stage begins with the Lantern King saying the following.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>“Long ago, Nyrissa insulted the Eldest with her arrogance and pride, and so we punished her. Yet we are not without mercy. I bade her replace the thousand slights she put upon us with a thousand kingdoms drawn from a thousand worlds. Once the task was done, I would have accepted her apology and would have granted those thousand kingdoms eternal glory as part of a greater world than their own. Yet you ruined this. It strikes me that now, this final apology falls upon you to offer me. Do you regret meddling in my affairs, mortals? Will each of you apologize for tampering with events beyond your reckoning?</p></section><p>The Lantern King expects each PC to answer. He doesn’t necessarily expect an actual apology, although humility in this regard is an easier solution overall. As each PC replies, decide whether that character is honestly apologizing (and should therefore attempt a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:35] check), offering a dishonest or evasive apology (in which case they attempt a @Check[type:deception|dc:40] check), or refusing to apologize or demanding the Lantern King apologize for his actions instead (which necessitates a @Check[type:intimidation|dc:45] check). The Lantern King is amused by evasions and threats in this stage, but it’s tougher than simply apologizing to successfully entertain him that way.</p><aside class=\"right\"><h3>Preventing Party Strife</h3><p>There’s a potential for player-versus-player conflict in this final encounter, but such developments are certainly not for every group. By this time in the campaign, you should know your players and their characters well, and if you feel that any of the players would not enjoy having a betrayal take place, you should alter the Lantern King’s invitation to join him. Instead, he should offer the party the chance to escape—those who take his offer will be given the choice to be sent away to “safety” just before he begins his attack on the party. A PC who willingly accepts this offer is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ] to the Material Plane, but as is the Lantern King’s wont, he sends them to an entirely different planet than their home.</p><p>Alternately, you can simply omit the third stage of the conversation entirely; it’s just as easy to resolve the discussion with only two stages as with three.</p></aside><h2>INVITATIONS</h2><p>Finally, the Lantern King raises a hand to his chin as he appears to consider his next words for a moment. After that moment, he speaks.</p><section class=\"description\"><p>“You are each certainly notable and impressive mortals, I’ll give you that. But you are limited by your own nature. Behold, then, my magnanimity: cast aside your petty nation and join my side as my servants, and you shall become legends not just in your own paltry realm, but throughout all of reality itself!”</p></section><p>The Lantern King won’t reveal more of what he offers the PCs if they join his cause, and regardless of how the PCs react, they’ll each need to decide how they want to frame their answers to him: respectfully (with a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:40] check), aggressively (with an @Check[type:intimidation|dc:40] check), or deceitfully (with a @Check[type:deception|dc:40] check).</p><h2>RESOLVING THE CONVERSATION</h2><p>If the PCs make it through all three stages of the conversation without attacking the Lantern King, take a moment to total up their Victory Points to determine their overall success. If the PCs earned a total number of Victory Points equal to or greater than the number of PCs, then the Lantern King is impressed by them. More importantly, the fetch stalkers he keeps at his side that take their appearances from the PCs take note and realize that they are mere shadows of the PCs’ glory, and they do not join the Lantern King in the battle to come. If the PCs earned fewer Victory Points than the number of PCs, the Lantern King cannot hold back his derision. He mocks the PCs’ failure with a barrage of insults and laughter that continues for 2 rounds. If the PCs attack him during these two rounds, he’s startled enough by their sudden bravery that he rolls for Initiative with a flat check.</p>"

Requests from the PCs for her aid in rebuilding their kingdom are met with a scoffing laugh unless the PCs can convince Nyrissa that they truly wish to help her and forgive her by adjusting her attitude to be friendly by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q] (her initial attitude is unfriendly unless the PCs honestly forgive her, in which case her initial attitude is indifferent). If she’s made friendly, Nyrissa feels a faint glimmer of hope for the first time in a long time, and she cautiously tells the PCs that she’ll “consider the offer.”</p><p>At some point during the discussion, though, the subject of the Lantern King comes up. Nyrissa knows the demigod’s anger and frustration at her not filling the <em>Apology</em> is inevitable, and while she knows that he won’t be able to leave these developments alone, she’s not sure what form his frustration will take other than that it will certainly affect the PCs as much as—if not more than—herself. The PCs, she warns, should be ready for anything.</p><p>On the subject of <em>Briar</em>, Nyrissa knows the only way to regain her ability to love while she still lives is to have the Lantern King unmake the weapon. She bitterly observes that “if he can’t be convinced by words, my only hope is to convince him by force.” She agrees at this time to let the PCs to keep <em>Briar</em> for the short term if they promise to help her secure the Lantern King’s cooperation, but makes it abundantly clear that her hope is that the sword itself will soon be unmade.</p><p>Finally, regarding the <em>Apology</em>, Nyrissa admits that the artifact was given to her by the Lantern King and that the grains of sand within it each represent one of the 999 previously conquered kingdoms. She isn’t sure whether those absorbed kingdoms are destroyed, in stasis, or something else, and muses that if anyone knows, it would be the Lantern King. What she can explain to the PCs is that the process by which a mortal kingdom is conquered and then absorbed as a grain of sand is a mystery even to her, although she can (and sometimes has) granted certain people from kingdoms about to be absorbed mercy to remain as her minions at times in the past. If the PCs fear that the <em>Apology</em> can still be used to absorb their kingdom, Nyrissa truthfully tells them that, now that she has been forgiven, she has no intention of continuing to pursue this goal. While the wrath of the Lantern King is certainly coming, the PCs and their subjects no longer have anything to fear from Nyrissa herself.</p>"

The PCs awaken in the Lantern Kingdom, as detailed at the start of @UUID[.BHJJrlOxFh1mhWhd], but when they do so, they are all @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv] as a result of dying in the Hunting Dream.</p><p><strong>Dream Victory</strong>: If at least one PC remains alive to defeat the wild hunt, describe the final blow or spell that ends the last of the fey cutting through to smash against the <em>Apology</em>, which suddenly shatters in a blinding blast of golden light.

This event occurs both in the Hunting Dream itself and in reality. As the <em>Apology</em> is shattered, the power of nine hundred and ninety-nine kingdoms at once are unleashed, allowing the Lantern King to instantly create a self-contained demiplane based on a theoretical apocalyptic future of the PCs’ kingdom in the Stolen Lands. The Lantern King invests a significant portion of his own being in this act, manifesting a living aspect of himself and also trapping the PCs and any of their companions within.</p><p>This is the curse of the Lantern King—that all who have ever sought the throne are doomed to wage eternal conflict, earning empty victories only to make the same war again tomorrow. To the PCs, the Lantern Kingdom appears as a shattered version of their own home, where they face familiar enemies they once thought they defeated. Simultaneously the defeated heroes of the other 999 kingdoms face their own apocalyptic nightmares as well, after enduring countless eons being trapped in a grain of sand. These realities exist atop each other but do not overlap—the PCs are unlikely to ever become aware of the true nature of the Lantern Kingdom, but regardless, they alone can do something to finally end this long-lasting torment.</p><aside><h3>Trapped in a Curse</h3><p>Once the PCs escape the Hunting Dream, they become trapped in the Lantern Kingdom. This isn’t meant to cut them off from their companions entirely. As this part ends and the next part begins, work with your players to decide what companions, if any, they may wish to bring with them into the Lantern Kingdom. Those associated with the PCs’ classes, such as familiars or animal companions, should be allowed to accompany them even if they were not present when they were pulled into the dream. Whether or not you allow NPC companions to come with the PCs is left to you. The PCs can also bring with them any items they may have not had on them at the time they were drawn into the Hunted Dream. If the PCs have additional magic items they wish to craft, identify, or sell consider delaying the start of the Hunted Dream until the PCs can get these affairs in order, since once the next part begins, there’s no turning back!</p></aside>"

Rumors of fetches that are reflections of entities from other planes persist, but none of these tales speak of fetches that duplicate anything other than a sapient source. A fetch can manifest spontaneously when a powerful creature undergoes a significant emotional event or dies, either while on the First World or while in an area significantly influenced by the First World, but one can also be created by significant forces like the Eldest in order to torment and vex those who have annoyed them. While a fetch manifests from a soul’s “reflection,” and as such bears a striking resemblance to that creature’s appearance in life, a fetch has no true memories of its own. It keeps fragments of false remembrances from its source as if it experienced them in a half-remembered dream—which ensure the fetch is enraged by and jealous of its source.</p><p>A fetch is similar in appearance to the creature whose soul spawned it, save that it often displays fey-like features such as pointed ears, plantlike elements, or supernatural grace. A fetch who seeks to impersonate a still- living source must disguise these features, and takes care to manifest its fetch weapon as one known to be wielded by its target.</p><p>When a fetch dies, it and its manifested items fades away into a bloom of plant life, its soul instantly recycled into the First World, leaving behind a patch of weeds and thorny flowers roughly in the shape they held in mockery while alive.</p><section class=\"fvtt clear\"><header><p>Effect</p><p>Reflected Souls - @UUID[Item.awjNC3D6ORfNjsJk], @UUID[Item.oW0E3JKrZ9rFRVLz]</p></header><section class=\"spotlight\"><article class=\"flexfill\"><p>Most of the fetches encountered in this chapter were created from the souls of characters that are known to the heroes.

Yet unlike an undead creature, a fetch is its own being, not a corruption or transformation of another creature’s soul. Fetches have souls themselves, yet since these souls are “borrowed” from energies underlying the First World, they have no capacity to gain in power once they are created. As such, fetches who live for any appreciable length of time grow increasingly frustrated with the stagnation of their personal growth, something of a curse that forces many to seek out increasingly dangerous risks. A fetch created from a still-living creature can, upon slaying its source, sometimes shed this limitation—in effect, taking the original’s place in reality. This drives most fetch to seek out their source, murder them in secret, and try to replace them, yet unless the original was as depraved and twisted as they, such deceptions are inevitably laid bare when a fetch’s evil nature becomes apparent.</p><h3>Freed Fetches</h3><p>If a fetch replaces its source by slaying them and taking their place in society, it can become a freed fetch. These are unique entities and should be hand-crafted as needed. All fetches begin their lives chaotic evil, but once they claim their place in the cycle of souls, they can (albeit rarely) find redemption. Fetches created by powerful entities after the source soul has moved on to be judged (including all fetches in Kingmaker) can never become freed, for they exist only at the whim of their creator.</p>"

She blames herself for allowing the weapon to fall into Irovetti’s hands, and even though this didn’t result in the sword’s return to Nyrissa, the close call shames and distresses Evindra for some time.

While Evindra doesn’t know all of <em>Briar</em>’s potential powers, she does know that, fully awakened, the sword is both intelligent and a vorpal sword, among other things. Once capable of speech, Evindra notes, <em>Briar</em> itself may be able to tell them more.</p><p><strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.fGmovu4cjIsUnACs.JournalEntryPage.JBlLiVTqW3eDUPch]</strong>: Evindra doesn’t know much more about Weren. She doesn’t believe that’s his full name and, while he appeared to be an attractive fey man with pointed ears, orange eyes, and long fingers, the way his form shimmered a bit leads her to believe he had disguised his true form when he delivered <em>Briar</em> to her. She says that he was very persuasive in convincing her of how important it was to keep the sword hidden. She believed him when he said he served the direct interests of the Eldest, but the more the PCs suggest that maybe he tricked her or even used magic to compel her, the more suspicious she grows about “Weren.”</p><p><strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.vtrUtpKwKZVyLdLD]</strong>: Evindra relates the legend of how Nyrissa fell in love with one of the Eldest and then how her resulting rise in power led her to proclaim herself one of the rulers of the First World. The other Eldest reacted poorly, first sending the jabberwock against her and then trying to rip her domain out from under her, but Nyrissa defeated the jabberwock and used a thousand promises of fey fealty to ward her domain. But when Nyrissa’s lover was exiled, she was punished. Evindra doesn’t know the details of that punishment, but she does know that Nyrissa still holds a grudge against the Eldest and suspects <em>Briar</em> has something to do with it.</p><p>Evindra knows that Nyrissa’s domain is called Thousandbreaths, and that it lies close to the Material Plane in the similarly named Thousand Voices, or Forest of Breath. She knows too that Nyrissa has long had an interest in the Stolen Lands, and that many of the region’s fey know of her and fear her; there are even rumors that the nymph queen walks the Stolen Lands now and then, visiting cruelties on those who annoy her and strange rewards upon those who please her. These rumors make Evindra suspect that there may be some physical connection between the Stolen Lands and the First World—and logic would dictate that a likely place for such a connection to exist would be the depths of the forest of Thousand Voices.</p>"

The method of defeating each bloom is different. Once a bloom is defeated, the PCs can harvest special trophies that allow them to enter and navigate Thousandbreaths with increasing ease; they’ll need at least three different types of bloom trophy before they can even open the portal to Thousandbreaths at the start of @UUID[.jPyYVsL4TUqIQ32v].</p><p>When the PCs defeat a bloom, the strange energies and First World power are released in a dramatic way. The energy suffusing the area rises up from the surrounding terrain in a vortex of green light and a high-pitched keening not unlike the sound of a mortally wounded rabbit or deer. This energy is eerie and disturbing, but ultimately harmless, and it disperses quickly. The majority of the energy returns to Thousandbreaths, though a number of objects at each bloom site are infused with a small bit of power turning them into bloom trophies—items that are magically linked to a specific area of Thousandbreaths. Each bloom encounter lists the type of object that becomes its bloom trophy along with its linked area. A dead creature that becomes a bloom trophy does not decay, cannot be transformed into an undead, and won’t be eaten by scavengers (such as maggots) for 100 days.</p><p>Bloom trophies radiate strong conjuration and transmutation magic. A successful DC 35 check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.eReSHVEPCsdkSL4G] allows a PC to note that the item has become infused with the bloom’s energies and now holds within it a magical link between the object and the First World. A character carrying a bloom trophy receives a +1 status bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability checks while in the trophy’s linked area in Thousandbreaths.</p><h2>Bloom Growth</h2><p>While the exact nature of each bloom varies, all of them—save for the @UUID[.AMmC4r0Kija5A9XZ] (below) and @UUID[.2k8Sa5ntykeuBzZB]—cause vegetation in their hexes to grow rampant and uncontrolled. These hexes are treated as difficult terrain as a result, and the DC of Survival checks attempted in them is increased by 5.</p>"

Notes on what to add to each glade encounter to make it a Severe 18 encounter appear at the end of the encounter in an “Unbloomed” entry.</p><p>If all of the creatures in a glade encounter are defeated before the glade’s associated bloom manifests during the month of destruction, that bloom does not manifest at all when its day comes.</p></aside><p>When @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.vtrUtpKwKZVyLdLD] founded Thousandbreaths, it existed fully in the First World, but after she was punished by the Eldest, they shed this domain from that plane. Today, Thousandbreaths exists as its own demiplane, where much of the realities of the First World hold sway, yet it serves also as a prison from which Nyrissa cannot stray for long.</p><p>Due to its nature as an obscure demiplane, travel to Thousandbreaths from another plane is difficult. The PCs could use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ] to travel there but only if they’ve fully researched Thousandbreaths by gaining at least 18 Research Points. Even then, they’ll need a special tuning fork to travel to the realm—although a copy of <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.LrDehrS5VtvF7nbg]</em> can function in place of such a focus for spellcasting. @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.U13bC0tNgrlHoeTK] can create a portal to Thousandbreaths, although as an uncommon 10th-level spell, the PCs might not have access to it.</p><p>A fixed portal does exist that links Thousandbreaths and the Material Plane—the main entrance to the ruins known as the @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF.JournalEntryPage.rRpbmn5PXfDOTiy9] deep in the forest of Thousand Voices. This portal flared open for a few months when Nyrissa’s attention first came to the stolen lands about two decades ago (it was at this time that Karn Zuddiger stumbled through the portal while exploring the forest, emerging just before it closed to go on to pen <em>Zuddiger’s Picnic</em>), but has remained inert since then. It’s not until the blooms begin during Part 1 of this chapter that the Castle of Knives portal opens back up. As long as the blooms remain active, the portal remains impossible to miss—any who approach the Castle of Knives see it as a vine-shrouded rent in reality. While the PCs won’t learn of this portal’s activation while researching Thousandbreaths, they can certainly infer its existence, but it’s most likely they’ll learn about it from one of their fey allies such as Evindra or Limm Ticklewing. Of course, unless the PCs carry three different Bloom trophies with them, they won’t be able to pass through this portal at all.</p><p>Once the blooms begin, a remarkable transformation takes place in the castle’s ruins—the castle appears as a strange structure of sharp towers and confusing architecture of dozens of colors that seem strangely too vibrant for the surroundings. The entire castle is surrounded by a wrought iron fence that contains a single gate flanked by statues of beautiful women. The transformation lasts until the PCs uproot Nyrissa’s realm, but the iron gate itself continues to function as a portal to Thousandbreaths as long as that realm continues to exist as a demiplane.</p><p>Regardless of the method the PCs use to travel to Thousandbreaths, they always appear in the same place: the Byway (@UUID[.2Z65BXwMzTkQ9dRZ])</p>"

As Thousandbreaths is under Nyrissa’s direct control, other realities exist in this demiplane as well.</p><p><strong>Eternal Twilight</strong>: It is always twilight in Thousandbreaths. No matter what time the PCs enter and how long they stay there, the sun never sets (although in fact time is unaffected and passes normally—the time of day is merely fixed in place). This ambient light provides dim light in the realm.</p><p><strong>Glades</strong>: A number of large clearings exist in Thousandbreaths—these are known as glades, and each contains a unique encounter area detailed below. Each glade is linked to one of the blooms that manifests in the Stolen Lands—a character carrying a bloom trophy from the linked area receives a +1 status bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, saving throws, and ability checks while in that glade.</p><p><strong>Sleeping</strong>: Visitors who sleep in Thousandbreaths are subjected to @UUID[RollTable.RyETqIR5yFNv4BmP] if the Nightmare Rook (see @UUID[.VooytwmPZQrM1I7N]) still lives or if the @UUID[.2k8Sa5ntykeuBzZB] bloom hasn’t been defeated.</p><p><strong>Sounds</strong>: These are the voices: the thousand voices of Thousandbreaths, the source of the region’s name. In truth, there are far more than a mere thousand breaths in Thousandbreaths, as the disembodied voices are from those taken and remade by the queen, cries of helplessness in a pitiless and unending twilight. Beyond the screams there are other sounds: weeping, singing of children’s rhymes, shouts of anger, feral cries, and howls—PCs who listen too closely might even hear familiar voices that could well sound like villains or friends who have died or gone missing over the course of the Kingmaker Adventure Path. The sounds of Thousandbreaths cause a –2 circumstance penalty on all Perception checks made to hear things.</p><p><strong>The Woods</strong>: Moving through the woods without using the paths and rivers is dangerous. The off-path woods are treated as greater difficult terrain and hazardous terrain, and characters take [[/r 1d6]] piercing damage for each Move action they take when they travel through these thorny, tangled woods.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>Effect</p><p>@UUID[Item.axydAfNb3J8hMFqI]</p></header><p>As your players explore the glades, you can use this effect on characters carrying the glade's linked trophy to provide them with a bonus to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws.</p></section><h2>Paths and Rivers</h2><p>Travel through Thousandbreaths is easiest via its network of paths and rivers, yet navigating them is nerve-wracking. Eyes blink from the dark of the forest, lights are dim and seem to have trouble illuminating beyond the paths, and even stranger lights dance and twitch in the sky above, almost as if the stars can’t decide on their routes through the darkening sky.</p><p>Two types of passages exist within the realm of Thousandbreaths—paths and rivers. Travel along a path is possible in both directions, but travel along a river always leads downstream—even if a person attempts to follow a river upstream by flying above it or reached is always the one they would have reached by moving downstream. The rivers always flow away from @UUID[.JcAvEG7qrQeNWnPF] toward @UUID[.hwO3Kbh0Izx5mQtF].</p><p>Any character who tries to fly above the top of the wood’s trees discovers an unsettling truth about the reality of this realm—there seems to be no world above the canopy. No matter how high they fly, the tops of the trees extend to what seems to be 200 feet above. Only Nyrissa and the Nightmare Rook (see @UUID[.VooytwmPZQrM1I7N]) can actually travel above the treetops of Thousandbreaths.</p><p>Regardless of the speed or method used to navigate a path or river, it always takes [[/gmroll 1d4]] hours to reach the next glade. Each time the PCs use a path to travel, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]; on a success, the pathway is perilous in some way—roll on the Pathway Perils table below to determine in what way.</p><table class=\"center1\"><caption>@UUID[RollTable.RbXf5uSHPzBZrefW]</caption><thead><tr><th>[[/r 1d4]]</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>This is a grassy trail, the edges of which are littered with statues of curious creatures that are at once human and animal.

She can create glades and their contents, but in order for them to maintain their shape, each glade must be tethered to a powerful entity so full of life that its presence acts as an anchor.</p><p>By defeating anchors, the PCs weaken the underlying structure of Thousandbreaths and cause it to drift further and further from the First World. Each time they defeat all of the guardians of a glade (with the exception of @UUID[.FX3GDvDIGbQTaR5k]), there’s a chance that the defeat is enough to cause Thousandbreaths to tumble cataclysmically into the Material Plane.</p><p>When the PCs defeat all the guardians of a glade, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:20]. On a success, Thousandbreaths is uprooted. On a failure, this DC is reduced by a value depending on the power of the defeated anchor (see the adjacent table), so that the next flat check is against a lower DC. If the PCs defeat all of the anchors, Thousandbreaths is automatically uprooted. Slaying an anchor’s guardian defeats it, as does transporting a guardian out of Thousandbreaths, for once a guardian is absent from this demiplane—even if for only a second—the tether they provide snaps. GivenWh a year, Nyrissa could restore a defeated anchor, but for the context of this campaign, you can assume a defeated anchor remains defeated.</p><p>If Thousandbreaths is uprooted, it manifests fully within the forest of Thousand Voices in the Stolen Lands, its glades appearing as different areas in the forest. When this cataclysmic event occurs, the sound of a thousand screams tears through the air, a horrific noise as the realm expels its thousand breaths at once. The denizens of the glades are traumatized by this event, and all surviving guardians become slowed 1 for the next 24 hours.</p><p>All of the otherworldly elements of Thousandbreaths vanish when it uproots, but for the most part the general natures of the encounters in unvisited glades should be relatively unchanged. More importantly, once Thousandbreaths is uprooted, Nyrissa can no longer use the Apology to absorb the Stolen Lands, as uprooting Thousandbreaths causes all active blooms in the Stolen Lands to end instantly (although any creatures active in those blooms remain in the area where the bloom was once located).</p><p>Only the House at the Edge of Time remains within what was once the demiplane—the plane’s borders now encompass only the glade that contains that structure and its surrounding lake. The PCs can still come and go via the portal at the Castle of Knives or other methods of planar travel, but now the Byway (area A) manifests at the lake’s edge near the bridge that leads to the House’s isle.</p><p>Given time, Nyrissa may be able to rebuild Thousandbreaths through the use of create demiplane, but once Thousandbreaths is uprooted, her plan to absorb the Stolen Lands is over. At this point the Stolen Lands are safe from her machinations—yet the PCs themselves most certainly are not, and in this development, the nymph queen begins a new campaign of vengeance against the PCs; see page 459 for more on this development.</p><section class=\"milestone\"><p><strong>Story Award</strong>: Should the PCs manage to uproot Thousandbreaths and cast the demiplane into the Material Plane, award them 120 XP.</p></section>"

This monstrous guardian of the skies above Thousandbreaths can visit the dreaming minds of outlanders who are foolish enough to sleep in Nyrissa’s realm, inflicting horrific living nightmares upon them. Yet it also serves as an expedient way to travel for many of the region’s creatures, for the Nightmare Rook is one of two creatures (the other being Nyrissa herself) that can fly above the trees of this realm.</p><p>The Nightmare Rook carries passengers only at Nyrissa’s direct request or as a result of magical control. It has excellent vision, and unless the PCs take pains to be stealthy as they enter this glade, the immense bird sees them and turns to face them as they approach. If they move more than a hundred feet into the clearing, it shrieks, spreads its wings, and swoops to attack.</p><p>The Nightmare Rook’s primary tactic is to split up the party by Snatching them and then flying to a different glade to drop them into the peril therein (it takes the Rook [[/r 2d6]] turns to reach another glade by flight, but it always takes it just one to return to its spire, regardless of how long it took to reach the other glade). The Rook is particularly fond of dropping victims into the Mire (@UUID[.xWZqVDCul4YpCaxc]) or the Fruiting Orchard (@UUID[.1pH3Z4bzZ12uCY78]). Thousandbreaths prevents creatures from being dropped into the woods themselves; a character who’s dropped anywhere other than a glade falls [[/r 2d10×10]] feet but finds themselves somehow landing at the same spot they were Snatched up from. The Rook returns to this glade as long as PCs remain within to repeat this process until it is reduced to fewer than 250 HP, at which time its frustration takes over and it lands to finish the fight with its spells and melee Strikes. It saves alter reality to duplicate a spell needed to remove a debilitating effect on itself as needed. If reduced to 90 or fewer HP, the Nightmare Rook calls for surrender and promises to fly the PCs to any glade they wish if they spare its life. Of course, this is a lie, as any PC who sees through its deception can tell.

This twisted annis hag has abandoned and forgotten her true name in favor of being known as the Knurly Witch. When the Knurly Witch first stumbled into Thousandbreaths 220 years ago, Nyrissa offered the annis a choice—die and feed her pet tarn linnorm, or live as Nyrissa’s servant. The annis made the choice easily enough and does not regret it, for she has been treated well by Nyrissa. Over the centuries, Thousandbreaths has accepted her as one of its own, and she now functions as a native to the demiplane.</p><p>Although the Knurly Witch is as evil as they come, she doesn’t immediately attack. She’s been warned of the PCs by Nyrissa, and she’s curious. She invites the PCs up to share tea with her as soon as she spots them. If the PCs agree to the invitation, the Knurly Witch adopts a strangely forthcoming and honest tactic as she serves them “tea.” A successful @Check[type:perception|dc:40] check is enough for a PC to realize the mixture isn’t actually tea.

If she thinks that it’ll make the PCs more cooperative, she proposes a free trade of information: for each question of hers they answer, she’ll answer one of theirs about Nyrissa. Of course, the Knurly Witch lies with each answer, trying to feed the PCs completely false information about the nymph queen in hopes that even if they believe one of her lies, their tactics will be compromised in a later confrontation. Eventually, either the Knurly Witch or the PCs are likely to grow tired of this, at which point the Knurly Witch can roll for initiative with a Deception check (she rolls with Perception if the PCs simply attack her on sight).</p><section class=\"encounter\"><aside class=\"right porthole\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/kingmaker/the-knurly-witch.webp\" /></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>The Knurly Witch</h3><p>Moderate 18</p></header><p>On the first round of combat, the Knurly Witch casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.b5sGjGlBf58f8jn0] and moves upward out of reach of foes on the ground.

Yet as strange as this warping of time may be, stranger still is the fact that such ripples and transformations remain constant, as if a storm of fractured time tore through the structure, only to be frozen forever in the middle of a chaos of a hundred different eras.

At this point, the PCs know that they have gained a +4 status bonus on all saving throws made against teleportation effects or attempts to banish them to another plane while in the House at the Edge of Time. Additional protections manifest during a few specific encounters as well, as detailed below—when these occur, the PCs experience the same brief déjà vu and strange memories of the future, alerting them that their exposure to the <em>Helix Theorem</em> has protected them.</p><p>In addition, any PC who is protected by the <em>Helix Theorem</em> in this way knows that they can reflexively shed this protection in order to manipulate time itself once only.

They can be glimpsed in mirrors, the scent of their perfume lingers at times in the air, and the meals they have yet to eat lie steaming on the table. The PCs are occasionally able to see or hear these phantoms, if only briefly. These phantoms can variously be of people and creatures they do not recognize, but now and then the phantoms draw from the PCs’ own minds, pasts, and futures—these phantoms might remind the PCs of allies, old enemies thought dead, or even younger or older versions of themselves. In some cases, these temporal phantoms can actually interact with the present—the text of the encounter provides details as to where these effects can occur. In others, you should feel free to liven up an otherwise empty room with a strange glimpse of something half-seen or partially heard as you see fit.</p><p><strong>Static Time:</strong> Features in the House can be altered (walls destroyed, doors bashed down, windows broken, furniture burnt, and denizens slain), but the contents of the House periodically “reset” as long as Nyrissa still lives. This reset occurs each time the PCs leave Thousandbreaths for any amount of time, unless they manage to uproot the demiplane. In this case, with the House’s glade being the only part remaining, the reset occurs 24 hours after the PCs leave the House; if the PCs return before this time passes, the reset doesn’t occur and the next time they leave, the 24-hour “countdown” begins anew.</p><p>When the House resets, broken doors reform, windows become unbroken, destroyed and disarmed traps rebuild themselves, and so on. Any resident of the House is restored to full Hit Points, and any ongoing affliction or magical effect that hampers them is subjected to a counteract attempt by the House, which has a 10th-level counteract check of [[/r 1d20+35]]. Residents that are killed remain dead, and when the PCs next return, any remains left behind have decayed away to skeletons as if years had passed. Residents that have been relocated to another plane entirely are similarly not restored by the House’s reset. Any items (such as treasure) the PCs brought with them out of the House when it resets do not vanish, but upon returning to the rooms where they found these items, the PCs discover phantasmal images of the removed items lingering in the places where they were originally found.</p><p><strong>Warped Dimensions</strong>: Time is not the only thing that’s warped in the House—the dimensions themselves are as well. In most cases, these manifest as strange curiosities, such as the elevation change in the courtyard not being reflected in the surrounding House itself, or the inverted storeroom at area @UUID[.GTFGgSdMJ5uJIMCj], or simply the fact that while some of the rooms have different ceiling heights or floor depths when explored, the exterior of the House suggests each floor has a constant level.</p><p>Of greater concern, though, is how teleportation effects function in the House. When a visitor to the House attempts any teleportation action, allow them a @Check[type:perception|dc:40] (master) check (or @Check[type:perception|dc:35] for any PC under the influence of the <em>Helix Theorem</em>) to notice something strange going on with the magic as they begin the action—the effect simply seems “off.” The PC can halt the action at this point without losing the resource to teleport. If the PC doesn’t notice the strange sensation or proceeds to take the action anyway, they activate the House’s teleport trap.

Here, the chance to perform <em>primal call</em> is a DC 35 check. The ritual, if successful, manifests a creature from Thousandbreaths itself. Nyrissa must still expend ingredients when she performs the ritual. If Thousandbreaths has been uprooted, this energy is drawn instead from the House at the Edge of Time—all that remains in the demiplane. In this case, Nyrissa and the defaced nymphs suffer a –4 circumstance penalty to their skill checks to perform the ritual.</p><p>Nyrissa always performs this @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.pZc8ZwtsyWnxUUW0] ritual at 10th level. She uses it to call an elite primal bandersnatch, elite sard, or elite terotricus, varying her choice each time so that the PCs won’t quite know what to expect. Each attempt at the ritual costs her 200 gp in resources, drawn from the supplies in area @UUID[.Fj2ryHevucvhU4QK]; she has enough supplies to attempt the ritual 10 times. She doesn’t need to offer additional payment to the creature, and she sends it on its way into the Material Plane to track down and attack the PCs. The creature manifests at the Castle of Knives (encounter site @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF.JournalEntryPage.rRpbmn5PXfDOTiy9]) in Thousand Voices. How it tracks down and attacks the PCs is left to you to determine.</p><p>Nyrissa continues performing primal call rituals in this way daily. Once she depletes her resources for casting the ritual, or once she rolls a critical failure on her check, she can no longer pursue this avenue of vengeance. Unwilling to leave her demiplane or to risk the House’s actual guardians, Nyrissa now turns her attention to hunkering down and waiting out the PCs. It’ll take her years to refocus her attentions on a new kingdom on a different world to attempt to gain her final apology—if it comes to this, the PCs can simply leave her alone and this chapter concludes. Yet the campaign continues, for the Lantern King himself grows impatient if this stalemate continues for too long—see @UUID[JournalEntry.fGmovu4cjIsUnACs] for details.</p></section>"

If the tactic works, he strings the PCs along with stories of how Heaven’s armies have come to the House at the Edge of Time to contain its dangers, and that from this point forward, no further action on the PCs’ behalf is needed to keep their kingdom safe. If the ruse works and the PCs leave, the Wriggling Man is somewhat surprised, but as soon as the PCs exit the room, he drops the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.0873MWM0qKDDv81O], casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.VDudQ4x2ozosAbTb], and then follows them for a minute to make sure they leave.

He continues to sustain his @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.0873MWM0qKDDv81O] as long as it makes sense to do so, casting offensive spells through the illusion as needed to fight the PCs. If his illusions are penetrated, he’ll work to avoid melee as best as he can, but if his magic incapacitates a character, he can’t resist approaching the poor PC to engulf them in his Squirming Embrace.

She never bothered restoring these rooms and instead converted the suite at area @UUID[.2RWV0uhIckv9e10j] to serve as her new private quarters, leaving this area in shambles. Today these rooms are a tangle of thick, creeping vines and plants that have grown riotously to a height of two feet throughout the area, making this entire area greater difficult terrain. In addition, a large number of damaged or destroyed statues of all manner of creatures lie strewn about the place; these were left by this area’s dangerous guardian.</p><p>When Nyrissa first began experimenting with the jabberwock’s blood in her efforts to create a lesser version of the creature, one of her first attempts involved infusing creatures with the ichor. All but one of these experiments died, but the survivor, a medusa named Phomandala, transformed into a scaly but quite healthy monster with a pair of sizable cobras amid the smaller tangle of her serpentine hair. Phomandala has lived in these ruined halls ever since, serving as a guardian for the upper floors of the House. Over the years, the infusion of jabberwock blood and her life on the First World have slowly granted magical powers as well, and the medusa is now a powerful sorcerer in her own right. Her insights into the nature of primal magic have been a boon for Nyrissa as she continued to absorb kingdoms, helping her to refine the process of creating Blooms. For the last several dozen events on the last several dozen worlds, though, Phomandala has had little to do to further refine the process, and she has instead spent the past century or two in this suite of rooms enjoying a sort of “retirement”—relaxing among her statues, meditating, and carrying on long, complex discussions with visitors that often last for years. Her latest companions are a pair of capricious whimwyrms with whom Phomandala has been debating for almost the entire time this Adventure Path has taken place. With neither the medusa nor the whimwyrms budging on their positions regarding the role of chaos and law in the First World, they’ve largely not even noticed the advent of this latest round of Blooms.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><aside class=\"right token\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/kingmaker/phomandala.webp\" /><ul><li>@UUID[Actor.S4oIMaVPzQuRaTpK]</li><li>@UUID[Actor.SfFMqKTUQ1Dwu5lT]</li></ul></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>Encounter</h3><p>Moderate 19</p></header><p>When the PCs arrive, Phomandala doesn’t immediately attack.

In the distance, a thin line of forest obscures the horizon in all directions. The ground bisects the sphere, filling its lower half with solid earth. A “sun” above provides bright light in this Fable.</p><h3><strong>Fable M7b</strong></h3><p>This chamber appears to be a single, immensely tall tree that extends forever in either direction inside a silo of impenetrable green leaves, with the tree’s 5-foot-wide trunk rising up at the center of the sphere. The number of branches and thick, sturdy leaves allow creatures to move in any direction by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy] with a @Check[type:athletics|dc:20|traits:action:climb] check. A <strong>critical failure</strong> at this check results in a heart-stopping moment when the creature experiences a disorienting “fall” of [[/r 1d10*10]] feet before landing prone at the place where they started the fall, taking falling damage as appropriate (this can occur even when the PC is standing on the Fable’s “floor” below). Only by deliberately Climbing or flying up or down can a character change their elevation in this Fable. The tangle of branches provides all creatures with standard cover against ranged Strikes. Shafts of “sunlight” filtering in from above provide bright light in this Fable.</p><h3><strong>Fable M7c</strong></h3><p>This chamber appears to be a vast stone plaza in a forest clearing under a moonlit night sky. At the center of the plaza stands a statue of Nyrissa, one arm held out as if in greeting. An inches-deep layer of crystal clear water covers the plaza itself, while the edge of the plaza (and the edge of the Fable itself) is ringed by an impenetrable forest. It is in this room that the House’s power is concentrated, and it’s here where Nyrissa spends much of her time—from here, she can observe every single room in her House simultaneously as if via @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.zvKWclOZ7A53DObE] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.HXhWYJviWalN5tQ2], switching her focus from one room to another by Envisioning. Nyrissa can immediately destroy any of her allies (but not intruders) in the House that she observes from here, taking a single Envisioning action to simply snuff out their lives and causing their bodies to burst. Nyrissa only uses this ability to destroy an ally who has become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr] by or seems to be allying with the PCs (an event likely to occur only with the unfortunate mephit in area @UUID[.sIRNvGkvWITSdBni], but if the PCs manage to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6] an important ally, Nyrissa opts for its destruction as well). Likewise, if the PCs are about to learn something important, the nymph may well send her closest allies to intercept the PCs. Moonlight from above provides dim light in this Fable.</p><p>This fable is likely to be where the players will meet Nyrissa. See @UUID[.k2Llwg0jHjCQQWfs] for information on how that encounter unfolds.</p><h3><strong>Fable M7d</strong></h3><p>This chamber is Nyrissa’s private bedchamber; it’s lit by several everburning torches. Unlike the other three rooms, this chamber’s borders are those formed by the twenty-foot-tall room itself, as depicted on the map; this room is what existed at the top of the House’s tower before Nyrissa created the Fables.</p><section class=\"treasure\"><article><p><strong>@UUID[Actor.yJuzwlk8GUlxTPnB]:</strong> If Nyrissa reclaimed <em>Briar</em>, the weapon lies casually tossed on the bed in area M7d. The room also contains a large number of trophies and prizes she has picked up or had her minions collect over the years, all of which have been collected from the Stolen Lands and help to focus the Fable upon this region. If these trophies are taken out of the Fable, Nyrissa cannot bottle the Stolen Lands until they are regained. These trophies consist of things such as a unicorn’s horn, a silver dragon’s claw, a tooth from Armag’s skull, and so on. Add other objects that the PCs at one time possessed but have since lost or sold. The more unique and recognizable these items are—like <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.DRmaSbUHZnLAZEpl]</em>, the <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.e28PY873NQzsrsdj]</em>, or the <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.i2bqAshUwNh9IClT]</em>—the more disturbing and shocking they will be for the PCs to find. Even items the PCs have destroyed can appear here, fully functional once more. Only if the PCs retained such treasures or locked them away safely should these things not appear here as trophies. Amid all of these treasures are numerous other obscure and expensive ritual supplies amounting to 2,000 gp in all for use in performing @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.pZc8ZwtsyWnxUUW0] rituals.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest treasure in area M7d, though, is the <em>Apology</em>. This glowing, bejeweled chalice sits on a nightstand near the bed, nearly filled with 999 glowing grains of sand—each of which represents a previously claimed kingdom. It is into this chalice that Nyrissa hopes to place the PCs’ kingdom as the final grain of sand. Rules for this powerful artifact are not presented in this adventure, as its goal is to serve more of a story element than to serve as a reward for the PCs or a viable tactic for Nyrissa to use against them in the final confrontation, but a few additional notes about it appear in @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.Jm18obt6pQZCl3jf] in this book.</p></article></section>"

The other realm’s influence has resulted in this woodland’s name changing to Thousand Voices.

The book gained notoriety in part due to Karn’s murderous killing spree only a month after the book’s publication some 20 years ago. As a result of Karn’s violent outburst, most copies of <em>Zuddiger’s Picnic</em> were destroyed. If the PCs haven’t secured their own copy of <em>Zuddiger’s Picnic</em> by this point, this check also reveals that a local aristocrat named @UUID[.8AdKadlNNj4F3xTa] is said to own a copy of this rare book.</p><p><strong>12 Research Points</strong> Thousandbreaths is a heavily forested realm.

Nyrissa, the ruler of the realm, is also known in some tales as the Queen of Forgotten Time, the Count’s Last Mistress, or the Heartless Queen.</p><p><strong>14 Research Points</strong> There are ten glades in Thousandbreaths—nine lesser glades each ruled by one of Nyrissa’s favored minions, and a prime glade in which Nyrissa’s home, the House at the Edge of Time, stands.

Each glade is “tethered” to a powerful entity so full of life that its presence acts as an anchor, and without these nine entities, the glades of Thousandbreaths would be uprooted.

If the nymph dies (likely to an unfortunate beheading from a sword forged of her own capacity to love), a strange and violent transformation ripples through Thousandbreaths. If it hasn’t yet been uprooted, it is uprooted immediately—including the House at the Edge of Time. The House quickly crumbles and suffers thousands of years of erosion at once as if inflicted by constricting vegetation, rainfall, lightning strikes, and subsidence, effectively transforming into the ruins known today as the Castle of Knives. The Fables vanish, leaving behind area @UUID[.Fj2ryHevucvhU4QK] as a normal room at the top of the tower. If the PCs were in another Fable at this time, they appear in this room. Regardless, any PCs in the House at the Edge of Time as it transposes to the Material Plane and erodes are protected from the swift decay all around them unless they fail a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:40] save, in which case they are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR] by the event.</p><p>During this reversion, Nyrissa’s body rises up on a pyre of black lightning. As it does, a terrible gale rips through all of Thousandbreaths. The Queen’s body acts as the center of this vortex and soon vanishes in a black pall of clouds. Within a minute, the unraveling is over. The House finishes its collapse and the surviving denizens of the building and Thousandbreaths flee into the strange new world they find themselves in.</p><p>What happens to the PCs at this point depends on Nyrissa's fate, and is detailed in @UUID[JournalEntry.fGmovu4cjIsUnACs.JournalEntryPage.dFEosCwJy4YHyty4]. While the PCs have defeated Nyrissa, one danger remains: it won’t be long before the @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.3pWxyt1JN8VaDS2y] makes his frustrations known.</p>"

According to their prediction, the Twice-Born would be a child formed from the spirit of the original Armag, a warlord who terrorized the northern plains during the Age of Destiny. However, because prophecy had ceased being a trustworthy source of prognostication with the onset of the Age of Lost Omens, the foretelling of Armag the Twice-Born took shape as little more than a wishful curse uttered against the Sisters’ enemies. So when no reborn warlord rose to give flesh and fury to the cult’s prediction, the sisters did not remain idle: they vowed to take an active hand in forcing their prediction to come true and retreated into the Stolen Lands where they abducted a Tiger Lord out on his first hunt. For years, they raised their pawn in the ways of spite and rage and gave him the name Armag.</p><p>The Sisters convinced their pawn that the spirit of the original Armag lay within him, and that they would serve as his guides to aid him in setting his ancestral might free. By advising and strengthening Armag, they planned to guide him to his rightful place among his people, uniting them to fulfill their own prophecy and strike back at Brevoy with an army of nomadic warriors eager to please their reincarnated warlord of old. Armag embraced these goals as his own, aspiring to lead the Tiger Lords. Empowered by the deceptive touch of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.zlJGKpeLBwajP91o] faithful, he slew a Tiger Lord boss and assumed the mantle of leadership.</p><p>Then settlers arrived from Brevoy. A group of soldiers and diplomats led by Baron @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.ADMctdyXAlSmymUG] spread south into Tiger Lord lands along the East Sellen River. These settlers not only established a fort on the shore of Lake Hooktongue, but they also sought out and looted several ancient tombs and burial sites sacred to the Tiger Lords. The final insult came when Drelev’s soldiers tried to establish an unfair alliance with the Tiger Lords. Armag saw through their trickery and ordered his people to attack, but he underestimated his enemy, assuming that “soft diplomats” would not be able to stand in combat. Drelev’s soldiers proved an able match for Armag’s kin and, after three nights of battle, the Tiger Lords fell back. Not only did Armag see his destiny of raiding Brevoy endangered, but suddenly he and his people were on the defensive, losing territory to Drelev’s expansion. However, as Armag fell back deeper into the hills, he found a new ally from an unexpected source: the realm of Pitax.</p><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.UG1YQsZGkWshc4AY], ruler of Pitax, had already become concerned with Rostland’s expansion into the Stolen Lands, and when he heard rumors that other Brevic agents were expanding south into more distant borderlands and displacing some of the Tiger Lords—a culture Pitax had often clashed with over borders—his paranoid fears saw opportunity. If Irovetti’s forces and the Tiger Lords could work together, they could swiftly defeat these intruders. And if events could be engineered so that the Tiger Lords were at the front of the battle, the bulk of the losses would be from among their troops, further reducing opposition to Pitax’s slow but eventual expansion into the Stolen Lands.</p><p>And so Irovetti and his guards traveled northeast to contact the Tiger Lords and establish a truce. Working together, they descended upon Fort Drelev with a fury and conquered the invaders in a single bloodless wave, for as Hannis Drelev saw the combined forces of Armag’s warriors eager for revenge and Irovetti’s armies readying their siege engines, he made a fateful choice. Always a realist, he saw immediate surrender as the only option to save his life.</p><p>The craven noble sent three riders under a flag of truce to plead with Armag and Irovetti to spare his region, proposing instead to ally with the bandits and to turn control of Fort Drelev to them. His offer to provide information on Rostland and PCs’ kingdom intrigued Irovetti but frustrated Armag, who had hoped for more bloodshed. To force the loyalty—and obeisance—of Drelev’s people, and to help appease the frustrated Tiger Lords, Irovetti accepted Drelev’s surrender, but only on the condition that Drelev’s settlers hand over five of their own as hostages until Drelev himself could prove his loyalty through servitude to Pitax.</p><p>Over the objections of his own men, Drelev did as Irovetti requested, commanding his senior officers to give their eldest sons and daughters to the warlord. However, one captain—a lord-knight named Terrion Numesti—refused. Drelev chose to make an example of Numesti by throwing him in jail and handing his daughter over to the Tiger Lords. Drelev justified this action to his people by assuring everyone it would save their lives and reiterating Armag’s promises that the hostages would eventually be returned unharmed.</p><p>In truth, Drelev cares little for anyone or anything that doesn’t advance his personal agenda. Jealous of the success garnered by the neighboring kingdoms—particularly that of the PCs—he believes his alliance with the Tiger Lords and Pitax will finally give him the means to take over the entire frontier. And with such a large nation under his command, he’ll be able not only to strike back against the Tiger Lords and Pitax, but he will perhaps be able to expand his control into Brevoy itself. In an attempt to sweeten the alliance, Drelev has returned several of the artifacts and treasures he and his soldiers looted from Tiger Lord burial tombs, something that Armag quite appreciated.</p><p>When Armag returned to his people with these artifacts, though, the Sisters recognized them as ancient relics in the style of the nomadic warriors of the original Armag’s time. Correctly assuming the barrow mounds these treasures came from would hold even greater treasures that could legitimize and spread their champion’s influence over his people, the Sisters advised the Twice-Born warlord to claim them as his own. To encourage his choice, they cited legends of how a Kellid shaman laid the original Armag to rest within the same hills along with his famous sword, @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.DRmaSbUHZnLAZEpl], a weapon blessed by Gorum to win any war and triumph in every conflict.</p><p>Now, while Armag is distracted with attempts to delve the tombs of his ancestors and Irovetti has returned to Pitax to prepare for his next audacity—an attempt to lure the PCs out of their kingdom so he can attack their homes in secret (a treachery detailed in full in the next chapter)—Lord Drelev has spent much of his time plotting and brooding. He hopes Armag meets a terrible fate in his people’s tombs, but he isn’t aware that Armag intends to collect the ancient weapon Ovinrbaane—and therefore Gorum’s blessing—and use it to raise his own army. Left unchecked, a mighty champion of war will walk Golarion again, brushing aside all opposition in the River Kingdoms and beyond.</p><aside><h3>Kingdom in the Background</h3><p>With the PC’s defeat of @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK] and the rescue of Varnhold, that town joins the PCs’ kingdom. With this success, the citizens finally put behind them the fears of the Season of Bloom, and the kingdom enters a growth spurt, expanding south up to the Tors and north beyond the Narlmarches. But as the kingdom grows, rumors and whispers that Pitax is growing nervous about their neighbor begin to spread. When running the troll attack on @UUID[.zW19kGYW1rUZqFST], simply have the mass combat elements play out in the background; focus instead on the PCs’ fight against Ameon Trask and his troll king allies. By the end of the adventure, the kingdom expands north of Hooktongue and talks of annexing Drelev may be afoot.</p></aside>"

Without reinforcements, the battle against the army will be tough, but not impossible, and its ultimate success will depend heavily on the success of the PCs’ own simultaneous attack on the army’s leadership. If the PCs traveled with an army or armies of their own, they can add those forces to the battle, but otherwise there may not be enough time to deploy any of their other armies to this location. Normally, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.ysKkyZp02RMujObE] activity must be taken during a Kingdom turn, but if you wish, you can allow the PCs to attempt to Deploy Armies that are relatively close to @UUID[.H7wXdZVu3jbnZrIk].

On a success, if the army had to travel no more than 2 hexes, it arrives at Tatzlford in time to aid in the battle, while on a critical success, an army that had to travel no more than 4 hexes can arrive in time. Regardless, the forced march causes any army deployed in this way to increase its weary condition by 1.</p><p>Thankfully, Kisandra’s warning affords the PCs enough time (barely) to mount a defense of Tatzlford. She can tell the PCs that the attacking group consists of 100 human mercenaries armed with longswords and composite longbows, 50 human Tiger Lords armed with axes, and a dozen immense trolls. The group is commanded by one of Drelev’s right-hand thugs—a pig of a man named @UUID[Actor.QF2AIby1vQRq5b9E].</p><p>Kisandra can tell the PCs that Ameon’s forces are somewhat disorganized and sloppy—Ameon’s not all that great of a leader and his tactics for the attack are likely to be little more than orders to charge the village en masse while he hangs back with a few guards to observe the clash from afar. The number of trained soldiers and grizzled nomadic warriors he commands more than makes up for these blunt tactics with sheer force; if Tatzlford’s guards were to meet Trask’s forces on even ground, the result would likely be a slaughter. She finishes by pointing out that since Ameon is likely to hang back to observe rather than take part in the battle, a targeted strike on him by the PCs could sway the battle in their favor.</p><h3>Intercepting the Enemy</h3><p>The PCs may decide not to wait for the fight to come to Tatzlford, and instead ride out with their army to intercept (or even ambush) Ameon Trask and his forces on the march. If the PCs have only Tatzlford’s army to attack with, Rezbin is wary as he rightfully points out that the town’s guards would be at a severe disadvantage in an open battlefield; by using the town’s fortifications as defenses, they’ll even up the odds.</p><p>If the PCs insist, Rezbin relents, especially if the PCs have brought their own forces.

Since then, the town’s population has decreased further as citizens succumb to illness or starvation, are imprisoned or beaten to death by unruly mercenary guards, or manage to build up enough courage to flee the town.</p><h3>B1. Watchtower</h3><p>This watchtower is staffed at all times by six Drelev guards (see @UUID[.9pQjIH4W04gcoV4h]). They spend most of their time watching the gap in the wall, hoping to spot anyone trying to escape the town, than they do looking outward for anyone approaching.

Gask himself spends his days toiling at building more weapons to arm the guards with or to ship to Pitax.</p><h3>B4. Temple of Erastil</h3><p>This large stone building is only a shell—the interior is incomplete and empty. The three priests who were to officiate here were all taken into the keep the day the baron surrendered, and there has been no sign of them since (all three were fed to the oozes in the caves below the keep).</p><h3>B5. Secret Escape Tunnel</h3><p>At the base of a 30-foot-high bluff is the secret entrance to the escape tunnel @UUID[.Kku6Vr4u4qC5tHgR] mentions to the PCs. Spotting the hidden door from nearby requires success at a @Check[type:perception|dc:35|traits:action:search] check; with Satinder’s advice, the DC to locate the entrance drops to 25.

The PCs can earn this XP award up to 4 times, but no more than once every 24 hours.</p></section><h2>Infiltration Tactics</h2><p>The PCs can infiltrate the town and gather information to assess the situation. Perhaps non-intuitively, daytime is the safer time to do so, as the bulk of the soldiers tend to spend more time sleeping during the day so that they can be more active patrolling the city once its curfew begins. As the town’s defenders are more vigilant and numerous during curfew hours—an hour before sunset to an hour after sunrise—the DCs of the skill checks detailed below are increased by 5 during that time.</p><p>The following tactics each afford the PCs a number of hours to explore Fort Drelev. At the end of that time, they’ll need to bring their infiltration to a grinding halt—if they’re moving about in public, they’ll be confronted by 4 Drelev guards within an hour during the day, or within 10 minutes during curfew.</p><p>For all tactics other than Stealth, the fact that the PCs are leaders and heroes of the neighboring kingdom works against them. A character who succeeds at a Deception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.AJstokjdG6iDjVjE] or otherwise disguise themselves against the guards’ Perception DC avoids this complication. If the guards recognize even one of the PCs as the enemy, they’ll attempt to arrest them, or even attack them if circumstances warrant.</p><p>A fight on the streets against a group of guards not only lowers accumulated @UUID[.kgDuT7kFc11G4NC8], but also limits the PCs’ options as word of the violence spreads. After the first fight, guards automatically recognize the PCs—if not as enemy leaders, then certainly as troublemakers—forcing the PCs to adopt stealth or disguises to avoid future confrontations. As a general rule, 4 more guards come to investigate a fight within [[/r 1d12]] minutes of the first fight’s beginning. Potentially, the PCs could defeat all of the guards active in the town, after which point they’ll be able to explore the town freely—albeit at a significant LP cost!</p><h3><strong>Bribery</strong></h3><p>Fort Drelev’s current guards are mostly recruited from mercenaries and ex-bandits, and as such, they can be bribed to look the other way. A bribe worth at least 40 gp purchases the PCs 8 hours of time to explore Fort Drelev, but the guards are greedy and word spreads quickly. With each bribe, the minimum price of the next bribe increases by 20 gp.</p><h3><strong>Deception</strong></h3><p>The PCs can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72] to the guards to convince them they’re legitimate visitors to the town (perhaps as merchants or traveling mercenaries seeking a place to rest for the night), or to claim that they are in fact citizens of the settlement. The guards haven’t bothered to get to know the townsfolk, so this latter lie is just as likely to succeed as claims of being merchants or mercenaries. Attempting to present themselves as friends of the baron will be met with derision and replies like, “The baron’s got new friends now!”; resulting Deception checks suffer a –2 circumstance penalty. On a successful Deception check, the PCs earn 8 hours of exploration time (or 24 hours on a critical success), while on a critical failure, the guards sense something is off and threaten to arrest the PCs if they don’t immediately leave town.</p><h3><strong>Diplomacy</strong></h3><p>The attitude of Drelev’s guards is initially unfriendly, but the PCs can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q] on them. If made indifferent, the PCs earn 1d4 hours of exploration time; making the guards friendly earns 8 hours. Making guards helpful via this method isn’t possible, although it can be accomplished with certain types of magic—doing so earns 24 hours of exploration time. If the guards become hostile, they immediately threaten arrest.</p><h3><strong>Intimidation</strong></h3><p>The guards are used to intimidation tactics, so any attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.tHCqgwjtQtzNqVvd] them suffers a –4 circumstance penalty. Success on an Intimidation check to Coerce the guards earns the PCs [[/r 1d4]] hours of exploration time, while a critical success earns 8 hours.</p><h3><strong>Stealth</strong></h3><p>The party can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.IE2nThCmoyhQA0Jn] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.tfa4Sh7wcxCEqL29] exploration activities to enter Fort Drelev stealthily. Avoiding the guards’ notice requires success on a @Check[type:stealth|dc:27|traits:action:avoid-notice] check (this equals a Drelev guard’s Perception DC) with the following outcomes:</p><ul class=\"outcomes\"><li><p><strong>Critical success:</strong> The PCs earn 8 hours of exploration</p></li><li><p><strong>Success:</strong> The PCs earn [[/r 1d4]] hours of exploration</p></li><li><p><strong>Failure</strong>: They can quickly turn back if they were attempting the check to initially enter the city and avoid a confrontation</p></li><li><p><strong>Critical failure</strong> (or on a regular failure while already in the city and attempting to extend exploration time): The PCs are confronted by 4 guards</p></li></ul><h2>An “Audience” with the Baron</h2><p>The PCs can attempt to deal with the baron diplomatically, but the baron is not a trustworthy man. If the PCs reveal who they are to the guards and request an audience with the baron, the guards arrest them, stripping them of weapons, armor, and gear before marching them to Drelev Keep. There, the PCs are taken down to the dungeons and imprisoned in area @UUID[.oHomlg9TVlccbdcP], while their gear is put in storage at area @UUID[.dzvKoXUmR8X4UK6m]. In time, the baron may or may not come to speak to them; it’s more likely he’ll rely upon Imeckus Stroon to perform these interrogations. The baron is interested in the defenses of the PCs’ kingdom and, ultimately, in them surrendering to his rule.

The tavern and brothel are busy, but mostly just because of the mercenaries in town, and even then they often don’t pay—they ‘put it on the Baron’s tab’ with the expectation that payment will come later, but it never does. Shipments of food come in every week or so from Pitax, but most of that goes to the guards or up to the keep. The common folk have to beg or scavenge what they can.”</p><p>“Baron Drelev recently gave shelter to a young foreign noblewoman named Lady Quintessa at his keep. She’s a lot younger and prettier than his wife, Baroness Pavetta. I’m sure there’s more going on there than mere kindness.”</p><p>“Shortly after the baron surrendered to Pitax and the Tiger Lords, his wife’s brother—a rather brusque, foul-tempered wizard named Imeckus Stroon—came to town. Since then, he’s sequestered himself in the keep, rarely emerging. No one in town knows what he’s up to.”</p><p>“No one knows for sure where the warlord Armag has gone. After accepting Drelev’s offer of an alliance in exchange for sparing the town, he took several people as hostages and marched into the hills. He’s supposed to return the hostages once the baron has proven his loyalty to Pitax (whatever that means), but most folk assume the hostages are already dead.”</p></section>"

The corrupt ruler skimped on the construction of the city’s wooden walls in favor of protecting himself with a keep of solid stone.

Feel free to expand on these locations as you see fit during play—any of them could serve as places to hide or areas for combat to spill over into.</p></section><p><strong>Exterior</strong>: The keep’s walls incorporate numerous watchtowers, including a larger main tower housing the baron and his retainers. Climbing the outer walls requires success on a @Check[type:athletics|dc:30|traits:action:climb] check.

A few locks (specified in the text) require unique keys. When combat starts, the guard carrying the key hangs back to provide ranged support; if it seems like the PCs are going to win the fight, the key-carrying guard flees to another group of guards, or performs an Interact action to break the key or throw it somewhere inaccessible rather than risk the PCs taking it.</p><p><strong>Combat</strong>: Many of the encounters with guards are trivial on their own; you should strive to have guards posted in nearby areas react quickly to the sounds of combat to help make these fights less repetitive and more dynamic and significant when they do occur. The PCs should fight 4 guards for a low-threat encounter, 5–6 guards for a moderate encounter, or 8 for a severe threat.</p><p><strong>Lockdown</strong>: If the alarm is raised in the keep, or if the PCs make their presence in town widespread (such as if they slaughter most or all of the town guards), Baron Drelev orders the keep into lockdown. In this case, guards move quickly through the building to lock all doors, and all guards on patrol are at heightened alert and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks for 8 hours, after which the guards are exhausted and suffer a –2 penalty on Perception checks for the following 16 hours.</p>"

Today, this tomb serves as a testing ground intended to reveal the God of War’s next champion.</p><p>In the earliest days of the Tiger Lords’ history, the original Armag led his people out of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords and into Numeria. They clashed repeatedly with others, eventually pushing through the Rostland plains to clash against the Iobarian warlords and centaurs of Casmaron. These conflicts hardened Armag, forging him into a legendary champion who earned the direct favor of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.88vRw2ZVPax4hhga], the Iron Lord and god of war.</p><p>Pride was Armag’s weakness. He boasted he would live forever—that death herself couldn’t slay him. Pharasma heard his boasts and was offended, and her anger manifested as psychopomps aided Armag’s enemies or sought to lay him low on the battlefield. This angered Gorum, who had come to enjoy Armag’s audacity and brutal nature, and as Armag fought against his enemies on the Material Plane, Pharasma and Gorum engaged in a battle of wits in the Great Beyond over the ultimate fate of Armag’s soul. When Armag finally succumbed and died on the field of battle, laid low by a mighty red dragon who served neither deity, Gorum intervened and infused Armag’s soul into his sword Ovinrbaane, preventing his soul from entering the Boneyard. He then sent visions to a Tiger Lord priest named @UUID[Actor.PK8yBANFyMqFZ3IY], inspiring him to construct a fitting tomb for the Iron Lord’s champion—a tomb that would be sufficiently protected with traps and guardians to test any who might come to claim the legendary sword. Gorum also elevated Zorek into a supernatural guardian to watch over the tomb, charging him with slaying the unworthy and adding their souls to the ranks of those keeping Armag out of Pharasma’s reach.</p><p>Pharasma, in her own inscrutable way, allowed all of this to occur, for it had been Armag’s fate. Still, she brooded for an eon before losing interest, while Gorum eventually moved on to other distractions as well. And so, for several centuries, just as the Tiger Lords themselves became estranged from their own past, Armag’s legacy dwindled into obscurity among the minds of mortals and gods alike.</p><p>This history of Armag’s Tomb is very obscure—success on a @Check[type:religion|dc:35|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check or a DC 30 check in an appropriate Lore skill (such as @Check[type:gorum-lore|dc:30|traits:action:recall-knowledge], @Check[type:pharasma-lore|dc:30|traits:action:recall-knowledge], or @Check[type:warfare-lore|dc:30|traits:action:recall-knowledge]) is needed to recall the legend.

Kingmaker assumes that the PCs travel to Armag’s Tomb well before Armag himself emerges, but if the PCs take too long, at your option the Twice-Born Warlord could rise to gather vast armies to his banner, forcing several mass conflicts against the Tiger Lords before the PCs are able to track him down to this location.</p>"

For enemy armies that you don't anticipate reusing, you can skip this and use unlinked tokens as normal, but if you wish to have a single army reappear several times- for instance, if an army defeats your players' kingdom in battle- you should give them a unique actor with a linked token as well, to differentiate them from other armies.</p><p>Since they are unique armies, the Tatzlford Town Guard and Narlmarch Hunters actors have already been linked.

But now it faces its most dangerous enemy yet, an enemy from within—its own king, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.UG1YQsZGkWshc4AY], who may be able to do through corruption and pride what three centuries of war and upheaval could not: bring Pitax to an end.</p><p>Since his flight from Numeria, Castruccio Irovetti has ruled Pitax for over half a decade, and in that time, he has firmly established his hold over this River Kingdom’s political scene through a mix of cunning choice and luck. While he does have the support of the nymph Nyrissa, he hid from her the fact that he’s managed to recover the magical sword she charged him with retrieving, making him loath to call upon her for aid. Furthermore, if he can defeat the PCs, surely that show of strength will bolster his reputation in her eyes, so that he can then present <em>Briar</em> to her for an even greater reward. In Nyrissa, Irovetti sees the only candidate he could imagine taking on as his Queen. See @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx] for details on Irovetti’s Numerian items: the @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.p7AccZi8BkUl465M] and the @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.8E3PycJpOr8Edoem].</p><p>Yet Nyrissa has had little time to wonder why it has taken Irovetti so long to find the sword, for as “War of the River Kings” begins, the time for her to gather up the Stolen Lands draws near. Through her manipulation of Irovetti, she hopes to spur the headstrong king into attacking the PCs’ kingdom. If the PCs don’t react in kind, she is prepared to send one of her agents to provoke them, but she hopes that Irovetti’s unprovoked attack does the trick. She then has but to wait for the human kingdoms that control the lands she wishes to take to weaken each other; she hopes that after the war is over, the surviving kingdom will be worthy of her eldritch assault on the land.</p>"

Fort Drelev has been incorporated into the kingdom, and its borders are creeping toward Pitax to the west. For the most part, you should present the battles that take place during this chapter (largely in Part 2) as events that occur in the background, and tie the overall success or failure of the war to the PCs’ own success in opposing King Irovetti.</p></aside><p>Once the PCs reach 13th level and have defeated Drelev and Armag, it’s time to begin this chapter. The PCs receive an invitation from Pitax’s King Irovetti to something called the “Rushlight Tournament.” The invitation arrives via messenger—a fleet-footed man named Velemandr (use the stats for a Pitax warden if necessary) who is willing to wait up to a day for the PCs to make their decision before returning to Pitax to report their response to Irovetti. The invitation is presented as @UUID[JournalEntry.1S5XVzEgRf2MKa6U.JournalEntryPage.rxU60B8rBbVzGdgx].</p><p>A PC who succeeds at a @Check[type:society|dc:20|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo] knows that the Rushlight Tournament is one of King Irovetti’s most popular traditions. A Rushlight Tournament has been held every year since King Irovetti claimed the crown; it’s a popular event that draws the majority of its contestants from Pitax but also sees participants from throughout the River Kingdoms. The tournament traditionally takes place on a small area of cleared land on the southern shore of the Rushlight River near the northeastern border of Pitax, just a few days’ travel west of Fort Drelev.</p><p>If the PCs don’t seem interested in attending the Rushlight Tournament, you can have helpful NPCs give some good reasons for taking part in the competition: even if the PCs don’t compete in the numerous events, attending the Tournament is a great opportunity to meet other notables of the River Kingdoms and to present themselves as the rulers of the newest River Kingdom, and failure to appear at this well-known and much anticipated event could be misinterpreted by other River Kings as a sign of weakness or even a deliberate insult or veiled act of aggression. Actually competing in the tournament and winning (or even placing) in the events would bring fame and prestige not only to the PCs, but to their entire kingdom. And finally, there’s the lure of the promised magical wand—this year’s grand prize for the kingdom that scores the most points during the tournament.</p><h3>Alternate Preludes to War</h3><p>This chapter assumes the PCs take up the invitation to participate in the Rushlight Tournament, but Kingmaker is first and foremost a sandbox campaign. Some parties may not be interested in participating in a tournament, and others may well (and rightly) suspect treachery from Irovetti. If the PCs decline the invitation, Irovetti is frustrated yet continues forward with his plans. The events of the Rushlight Tournament take place off-screen (and you can use the rules here later if you wish, with a few names changed, to present a tournament the PCs’ own citizens put on in their honor—in this case, the competition is largely for fun rather than for a vaunted prize, fame, and glory), and the PCs are free to continue to explore the Stolen Lands and build up their resources. Once the PCs reach 14th level, King Irovetti launches an attack on one of their kingdom’s settlements and you can proceed with @UUID[.QrjFBXxQxXqklz0L].</p>"

Lush, red carpets cover the ground and a dais supporting a carved and gilded chair evoke the feel of a throne room, while a haphazard collection of pedestals bearing sculptures and mounted paintings of wildly varying quality and realism suggests a strange sort of art gallery. A small, raised stage supporting numerous large musical instruments sits to one side of the pavilion.</p></section><p>King Irovetti is a handsome, muscular, dark-haired man clad in deep red velvets. A crown sits comfortably on his brow and an elegant cloak drapes his shoulders. His belt is thick with tools, weapons, and pouches, bespeaking an adventuring lifestyle not completely left behind. He also carries two strange pieces of equipment: The first and most impressive is a long staff of unusual metal, one end of which is fitted with thin blades and a spike that periodically shift and move with a soft whirring noise. The second is a thin, short rod of strange metal with a single spike at the end; small, circular lights periodically flash along the length of this rod. Both of these curious items are Numerian devices (a @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.8E3PycJpOr8Edoem] and a @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.p7AccZi8BkUl465M]).

For now, though, he wants the PCs to feel as comfortable as possible, and he has no intention of treachery. The food and wine he offers are safe and delicious, and the idle questions about how they and their kingdom fare are relatively meaningless. If the PCs ask him point blank about Drelev, he seems to be somewhat embarrassed and admits that “Lord Drelev was, shall we say, a bit too eager for his own good. He got what he deserved, and I’m only thankful that you put him down before he caused both of our kingdoms more damage. I trust his attack on your town of Tatzlford left no lasting problems?” Irovetti does his best to steer talk away from politics, though, reminding the PCs that they are here for a festival, not a summit.</p><p>This chat should be relatively short—before long, Irovetti indicates he has much to do to prepare for the games, and he invites the PCs to retire to their assigned pavilion on the Royal Blue. He wishes them well in the games to come, and with that the PCs are expected to leave the tent and return to the festival grounds.</p><section class=\"quest\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>Quest: The Rushlight Champion</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>80 XP</li><li>80 Kingdom XP</li></ul></header><article><p>The PCs must compete in the Rushlight Tournament against several other River Kingdoms, either on their own or by selecting champions to represent their kingdom.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> King Irovetti.</p><p><strong>Completion:</strong> Earn the most @UUID[.r1H2WrJ9lUfh7AkC] overall.</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> A wand of magnificent mansion and 8000 gp.</p></article></section>"

Much speculation on the audacity and nature of the tales to be shared during the boast make the rounds in the days leading up to this event.</p><p><strong>Contest Rules</strong>: For this event, a wooden platform is built in the center of the Coliseum. In turn, each contestant takes this stage and boasts to the audience of one of their greatest accomplishments. The boast must last for 15 minutes and must consist of a beginning, a middle, and an end.

In this contest, a Boast consists of three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end. To begin, the character introduces themselves and sets the scene for the story. The character then goes on to tell the bulk of the tale in the second part. In the final part they conclude with the story’s climax. In each part, the character can decide to:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li><p>Entirely make things up by attempting a @Check[type:deception|dc:31] check,</p></li><li><p>Relate the events in a way that appeals to the specific audience’s interests with a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:31] check,</p></li><li><p>Present the story in an intense and frightening way with an @Check[type:intimidation|dc:31] check,</p></li><li><p>Enhance the tale with their own storytelling craft with a @Check[type:performance|dc:31] check,</p></li><li><p>Impress the audience with fine details and bits of knowledge on the topic with a <strong>Lore</strong> check appropriate to the story’s topic.</p></li></ul><p>Boasting is meant to keep the audience enthralled and surprised, so the boaster must use a different skill check for each of the three parts unless they critically succeed at a check, in which case the audience loves that style of boasting so much that the boaster can use that check again for their next Boast check.</p><p>This particular contest is a 13th-level encounter, so in all cases, the DC for these checks is 31. If you wish to include Boasts in other encounters, you should use the appropriate DC by level.</p><ul class=\"outcomes\"><li><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The audience reacts with cheers, screams, and laughter as appropriate to the tale.

A few chuckles and screams and applause happen here and there.

King Irovetti has a strong dislike of the woman, as she has rebuffed his advances numerous times and seems to have no fear of speaking out against his rule in Pitax, yet the fact that she’s so well-loved by the populace and has won the boasting competition every year ensures her role—Irovetti would rather Pitax keep its crown in this contest than silence the bard. Annamede remains as charming and arrogant as she was when the PCs first encountered her during the hunt at the start of the Season of Bloom (see @UUID[JournalEntry.Kmwzfr7NS9r9Vhb0]). Since then, her fortunes in Pitax have grown considerably, and she’s gained five levels of experience since her previous encounter with the PCs. (If Annamede did not survive the hunt, her sister Ilemestra fills her role here; Ilemestra is antagonistic to the PCs as—rightly or wrongly—she believes their actions contributed to Annamede’s death.)</p><hr /><p><strong>Strategy</strong> Annamede’s boast should interest the PCs in particular, for she claims to have spent the past several months (or years, as appropriate for your campaign) spying upon the PCs’ kingdom. The nature of her boast varies. If the PCs didn’t particularly impress or befriend her in Chapter 5, she speaks of how she used her influence and skills to cause all sorts of misfortune in the PCs’ kingdom. You can cite specific events or developments from the past several sessions of play to make it seem like Annamede was the behind-the-scenes instigator of these events. If, on the other hand, the PCs impressed her in Chapter 5 by gaining at least 4 Influence with her, her boasts instead reveal how she aided the PCs’ kingdom behind the scenes, helping to prevent greater disasters or otherwise taking the credit for kingdom successes in the past several sessions. Whether or not these boasts are true, her knowledge of various embarrassing failures and problems the PCs have had with their kingdom should feel eerily accurate. At your option, if a particular PC made a significant impression upon Annamede (either negative or positive), she’ll throw out a specific insult or compliment as appropriate.</p><p>If Annamede’s boast is positive or complimentary to the PC’s kingdom, a PC can attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:30] check to notice some pointed glances between Annamede and King Irovetti—she’s obviously enjoying how her compliments are making the king squirm.

It’s something of an unspoken tradition that those who participate in the Midnight Joust are drunk; certainly, the majority of the audience is. The Midnight Joust, as implied by its name, takes place at midnight on the last day of the Tournament. The Coliseum is well lit by dozens of everburning torches, many of which are held by drunken observers in the stands. Those who elect to participate in the jousting while drunk are effectively @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18] at the start of their joust; jousting while drunk amuses the crowd but doesn’t grant any additional points.</p><p><strong>Contest Rules</strong>: Each jouster is equipped with a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.OPMzQdM9rZznMGhW] and a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.ezVp13Uw8cWW08Da]. Riders may provide their own armor and gear, but they must use the weapon and shield provided. A heavy horse and a military saddle are provided for anyone who doesn’t have their own mount. Once all six contestants have their mounts, the joust plays out over three stages, with each nation’s champion facing off against one opponent. King Irovetti has predetermined who’s jousting whom, but he does not reveal this information until the start of each stage.</p><p>A joust consists of both competitors beginning at opposite ends of the jousting arena. The competitors have 1 round in which they can prepare for the joust (the PCs are allowed to cast spells or otherwise prepare the jousting PC for the event as they wish during this round), after which Nunzio drops the flag and the two jousters charge toward each other, lances lowered, in an attempt to unhorse the other. Both jousters make Nature checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe] to determine initiative as they charge toward each other; a character with wild empathy or who can speak to their mount can instead roll Diplomacy to determine initiative if they wish. In the event of a tie, both strike at each other simultaneously, possibly unseating each other in a dramatic clash.</p><p>When a character attempts to unseat a foe during a joust, they attempt an Athletics check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.7blmbDrQFNfdT731] their opponent. On a success, the foe can attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:30] save to resist being unseated. On a <strong>critical success</strong>, the foe is automatically unseated. On a <strong>critical failure</strong>, the Shoving character is instead unseated and tumbles to the ground. If the first jouster fails to unseat their foe but remains seated themselves, then the second jouster attempts to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.7blmbDrQFNfdT731] the first jouster. If neither jouster is unseated, they replace their lances and shields (both are designed to shatter dramatically when they are used) and line up for another go. Any attack against a foe’s horse is grounds for disqualification.</p><h2><strong>Stage One</strong></h2><p>This stage consists of three separate bouts. In the first, Pitax’s champion Villamor Koth, whom the PCs encountered in the first two events, faces off against a staggeringly drunk human man named Khristel Cotoio from Mivon. As the joust begins, Khristel vomits and topples from his horse, blacking out from the drink. The crowd particularly enjoys this turn of events, although Villamor is frustrated at being denied a chance to show off his skills and sends a tirade of insults at Khristel as his allies drag him from the field.</p><p>In the second bout, the champions from Daggermark and Gralton clash spectacularly, with Chantal Urena (a female human ranger from Daggermark) unseating Sir Briannel Paulson (a male human ranger from Gralton) from his horse.</p><p>In the third and final bout of Stage One, the PC’s chosen jouster faces off against Damanjot, the Tymon champion whom the PCs previously encountered in the archery contest.

He does not attempt to unseat a PC contestant when it gets to his turn in the joust, but instead makes a lance Strike against his opponent, following a successful Strike up with a Knockback. This forces the PC to attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:30] save to resist being unseated. To the observing crowd, Villamor’s tactics are easily mistaken for overly aggressive attempts to unseat a rider—the crowd certainly loves the violence. If he’s properly unseated by a PC, Villamor swallows his pride for now and nurtures the thought of revenge—he’s one of Irovetti’s closest allies, after all, and knows that the king plans to go to war.</p></section><p>Villamor does not fight to the death at this time. If the PCs respond to his goading by attacking, he’ll “defend” himself (and attempt to kill the attacking PC), but if all the PCs start to gang up on him, or if he’s reduced to fewer than 150 Hit Points, he breaks off his attack and Irovetti steps in to try to calm things down. Villamor resists the urge to Rage during this fight so he can keep his cool and not escalate things too far as a result. If the PCs continue to attack, Irovetti uses magic to escape back to the Royal Pavilion with Villamor and announces that the Rushlight Festival is canceled due to unwarranted aggression on a visitor’s behalf. He gives the PCs an hour to leave Pitax before he attempts to have them arrested as criminals; this development gives him a handy, if flimsy, excuse to go to war with the PCs’ kingdom. Certainly, the PCs aren’t thought of kindly by the other competitors and attendants at the festival, for they see the PCs as the ones responsible for the tournament’s cancellation in this case.

This force is expected to crush the PCs’ resistance, thus impressing on the players the seriousness of the situation, but it also represents the bulk of Irovetti’s field forces. The rest of his armies remain behind to fortify his territories (detailed in @UUID[.f6RD4Y7dVu6DZMsD]).</p><p>Irovetti’s armies are led by @UUID[Actor.VSffsyt5RONB4k2U], the commander of all of Pitax’s forces, and the defenders should witness the onidoshi acting during the battle—perhaps he’s using <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.3puDanGfpEt6jK5k]</em> to blast foes, or he’s simply bellowing commands to foreshadow the PCs’ eventual confrontation with him later in this chapter—but he does not remain behind once the battle is over. Avinash isn’t particularly stealthy in his approach, and any defending armies should be able to march out onto the field to meet him before they reach the settlement.

In this event, at the start of a Kingdom turn, the kingdom gains 1 Unrest and does not increase any Ruins.</p><p><strong>King Irovetti is Defeated</strong>: Once the PCs defeat Irovetti (either by killing him, forcing him to abandon the region, or securing his surrender), the War of the River Kings ends and wartime fatigue penalties to the kingdom no longer accrue.</p><h2>Nature's Wrath</h2><p>Nyrissa doesn’t sit idly by as Pitax goes to war against the PCs.

When Nyrissa’s attentions turned to the Stolen Lands years ago, the Lantern King’s agents chose Whiterose Hill as <em>Briar</em>’s new hiding spot, placing it in a subterranean pool below the hill.</p><p>The pool and the hill itself were far from unpopulated. Above, Whiterose Hill had long been the site of an abbey dedicated to Cayden Cailean and built by priests from Galt, while downhill a small winery produced high-quality, small-batch wine and beer. A cave entrance near the winery led deep under the hill to the pool, where a nereid named @UUID[Actor.cPcregujkG0LUHiG] had dwelt long before the priests came to the hill. For many years, Evindra remained hidden from the priests, watching quietly in hiding each time they came to the pool to gather the remarkably pure waters to aid in the production of their beer, but eventually the need for companionship drove Evindra to reveal herself. The priests welcomed her presence, seeing her as a benevolent spirit once she began to teach them the secret of how to enhance the quality of their brewing even further using a combination of primal magic and more precise methods of water filtration. The priests themselves agreed to limit their trips to her home, visiting her only once each year when their grain harvest began.</p><p>When the Lantern King’s agent, a unique shapeshifting fey creature named @UUID[Actor.qLfHY6uNUQ99NZei] (“Weren” for short), arrived with <em>Briar</em> not so many years ago, he tricked Evindra into believing the weapon was a cursed sword that needed to be hidden from the world. She fell for the smooth-talking fey’s lies, and never told the abbey priests of her new role.</p><p>It all came to an end when a new priest, Barlin Gablivix, arrived at Whiterose Abbey. When his lechery and embarrassing antics caused him to fall out of favor at a temple to Cayden Cailean in Galt (just a year before the Red Revolution would tear that nation apart), the church gave Barlin a choice: excommunication or exile. He chose the latter and was sent to Whiterose Abbey, a place the church assumed would be remote enough that Barlin would have the chance to reflect on his choices while gaining the guidance of the local priests to mend his ways. At first, Barlin’s skill at gardening and cultivating vineyards was seen by the priests as a great boon, but when they finally revealed to the halfling their secret—that their beer production was aided by a fey ally—he became obsessed with Evindra.</p><p>One night, Barlin stole Evindra’s shawl and gained a considerable bargaining chip. He forced Evindra to assume elemental form, and then imprisoned her in a water clock that would prevent her from returning to her true form, so he could keep her to himself. Soon after, the gardener discovered the treasure Evindra had been guarding—an exquisite sword. As soon as Barlin touched the weapon, its suppressed personality stirred, influencing Barlin and amplifying his jealousy and paranoia. It was only a matter of days before <em>Briar</em> drove Barlin to believe that the other priests at the abbey coveted his “bottled bride.” Driven beyond reason, he used Briar to slay everyone else in the Abbey, then retreated into hiding near the subterranean pool. The abbey’s remote location and the fact that those who had financed it in the first place had been slain during Galt’s recent Red Revolution ensured the gardener’s isolation for many years.</p><p>It wasn’t until recently that Irovetti’s agents discovered Whiterose was the site of <em>Briar</em>’s hidden vault. They found the subterranean chamber and the fanatic gardener therein. A battle ensued, but they prevailed—after slaying the gardener, they returned to Pitax with <em>Briar</em> and other treasures Barlin had hoarded, including Evindra’s shawl. They left Evindra herself trapped in her water clock simply because they didn’t find where Barlin had stashed the elegant device away.</p><p>Yet the ill times at Whiterose did not end. Barlin lost his name and his life when he rose as a ghost, finally bringing a bit of truth to the old stories that the place is haunted. This latest development is unknown to Irovetti—he chose Whiterose as a place to spring his trap on the PCs partially because of its remote location and partially because if the PCs succumbed at a supposedly haunted abbey, suspicion would be levied against the supposed ghosts and not himself. To ensure such a fate meets the PCs when they arrive, the king of Pitax sent one of his most dangerous minions—a wererat murderer named @UUID[Actor.SZVTHAwTVXDwIOqC]—along with a small group of soldiers to set up an ambush. Yet the would-be murderers have found, much to their discomfort, that the rumors of Whiterose being haunted and infested by dangerous vermin are disturbingly accurate, and as a result they’ve had some difficulty in preparing their deadly reception for the PCs.</p><section class=\"skill\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>Researching Whiterose Abbey</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Exploration</li><li>Concentrate</li><li>Secret</li></ul></header><p>Once the PCs hear about Whiterose Abbey or learn of Irovetti’s supposed plot, they may wish to do a bit of research on the site before they visit it.

The priests were likely not slain by bandits, though, as none of the abbey’s valuables ever surfaced in illicit markets where bandit-stolen treasures would have likely to have been sold.

The priests of the abbey were slaughtered and the site plundered, rumor holds, by bandits, back in 4668 ar.

Thick swaths of kudzu-like vegetation grow on the hill, and the wide path that once led up to the abbey itself is now little more than an overgrown trail. A low stone wall encircles the hill, built decades ago by the priests to delineate the land granted them by the church. This same stone wall now marks the extent of the Gardener’s influence—inside the wall, the air feels strangely thick and humid, almost as if the hill were under an immense greenhouse rather than on the slopes of a temperate mountain range. The Gardener’s influence manifests in other ways as well, causing vegetation to shift and writhe at times without an apparent breeze and causing weeds and vermin to grow to excessive size and strength. At night, the susurrus of the fields and vegetation rustling is unnerving in the still air, and languid fireflies the size of apples bob and dip in the air generating motes of sickly green and pale yellow light.

Merchants from numerous River Kingdoms come to hawk their wares at this event; traditionally, even Brevoy sends some representatives, although this year marks the first with no official Brevic presence as internal tensions in that nation are nearing a breaking point. Wandering merchants jockey for space, crying their wares, whether hot from a basket or cool from a cask. Stages with jugglers, minstrels, mummers’ troupes, and trained animals dancing and leaping all vie for the attention (and the coin) of the crowds reveling in King Irovetti’s bounty.</p><p>The festival begins on the first Fireday of the month (although you should feel free to adjust this date to anything that you wish to fit the realities of your Kingmaker campaign). The first day of the tournament is given over to trading, feasting, a preview of the beasts of the traveling menagerie, entertainment (of varying quality), and after sunset, a grand display of fireworks. The next three days are highlighted by contests at the Coliseum, then followed by a day of rest. Finally, on the sixth day, the tournament concludes with a nightlong celebration of wine in honor of Pitax’s many vintners, all culminating in the traditional Midnight Joust, after which the winner of the tournament is announced.</p><h3>Festival Locations</h3><p>The festival grounds themselves are laid out along Cutter’s Creek, a minor tributary of the Rushlight River. The major features of the festival grounds are described below; all of these locations can be visited at any time by curious PCs.</p><p><strong>Coliseum</strong>: All of the official tournament events take place in this large field of hard-packed dirt. The northern side of this large, open field has rows of bench seats for spectators. A noble’s box stands at the east end of the field; seating there is limited.</p><p><strong>Menagerie</strong>: This enormous purple pavilion is a showplace of tamed horrors and monstrosities from across Golarion. The mysterious Madame Duclarion (CN female human sorcerer 10) and her hulking handlers, the Brothers Ohka (CN male @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.gdXok08bITkhowDJ]), keep a charmed menagerie of dinosaurs, rare animals, and supernatural beasts culled from every land for the viewing pleasure of festival-goers. Madame Duclarion keeps her creatures (and her handlers) calm and controlled through judicious use of various enchantment effects.</p><p><strong>Rotunda</strong>: The Rotunda is where tickets to tourney events can be purchased; each day’s events cost as little as 1 sp for a single ticket to as much as 100 gp for a noble “box” suitable for seating up to 10.</p><p><strong>The Royal Blue</strong>: The buildings that surround this small lake are grand silk pavilions facing the water. These are reserved for the private use of visiting dignitaries from the other River Kingdoms, with flags flying above them marking the lands of their inhabitants. If the PCs accept their invitation to the event from Lord Irovetti, they are granted the use of the easternmost pavilion for the duration of the event.</p><p><strong>Royal Pavilion</strong>: This pavilion is used by the king. Irovetti keeps the pavilion protected with a private sanctum heightened to 8th level, so that anyone who peers into the tent sees only a dark, foggy mass.</p><p><strong>Staging Pavilion</strong>: This pavilion is used for competitors preparing for games or other competitions in the coliseum. The pavilion has several smaller areas formed by canvas walls around a central area for competitors to gather in before they emerge when announced for a competition.</p><h3>Tournament Security</h3><p>Many of Pitax’s most capable guards serve long hours as security. The bulk of these guards are the equivalent of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.npc-gallery.Actor.B13dyXTo1xWVyj2R] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.npc-gallery.Actor.TgeUj2IiyoTeZHIO], but a more dangerous type of guard patrols the tournament grounds—and Pitax itself. These are the notorious @UUID[Actor.SaSXYUpSWIFHIzET]—battle-trained soldiers who augment their skill at swordplay with occult magic.</p><h3>Meeting the Competition</h3><p>This year, the participants consist of six kingdoms in all, including the PCs’ kingdom.</p><p><strong>Daggermark</strong>: Daggermark, as one of the most successful River Kingdoms, attends the competition out of a sense of duty, although their competitors are generally more interested in the entertainment than they are at actually competing for the prize.</p><p><strong>Gralton</strong>: The kingdom of Gralton has suffered long and hard to survive, and their reasons for competing this year are the same as every year: if they can win, the fame and glory and monetary awards will help their nation greatly.</p><p><strong>Mivon</strong>: Although Mivon’s relations with Pitax are shaky, with skirmishes common along their borders, the two nations are currently in something of a peace.</p><p><strong>Pitax</strong>: Although Pitax hosts the competition, its champions feel no shame or awkwardness over competing themselves.</p><p><strong>Tymon</strong>: The kingdom of Tymon is famous for its own competitions and gladiatorial battles. King Ungin sends representatives to all of the competitions and tournaments that occur in the River Kingdoms if he can, large or small.</p>"

All competitive events take place in the Coliseum and, with the exception of the Midnight Joust, begin an hour before noon. Typically, the competitions last for a few hours, with the day’s winners announced at the rotunda in the Commons in the early evening.</p><p>Although King Irovetti serves as the arbiter and final judge for all of the events, his master of ceremonies, an unarmored Pitax Warden named @UUID[Actor.ZYhBJZZkMMLzlxl2] (N male human royal guard), handles all of the announcements, introductions, and commentary during the games. At some point on the first day of the ceremony, Nunzio approaches the PCs and briefly outlines the nature of the four events for them, describing them as “an archery contest using longbows, a test of strength using handaxes or greataxes, a boasting contest, and a drunken jousting competition.” He assumes the PCs’ kingdom will be participating in the tournament and needs to know who their competitors will be for each event, along with how each competitor wants to be announced at the start of each contest.</p><h3><strong>Contest Rules</strong></h3><p>The schedule of games is posted throughout the festival grounds. Each competition has its own rules, but there are three rules that govern all of the events: harm no spectators, kill no competitors, and don’t get caught cheating (canny PCs will note that “don’t cheat” is not a rule). Breaking any of these rules is grounds for disqualification from that event.</p><p>Each contest has a first-place winner and a second-place winner; those who don’t place first or second win no accolades at all and are instead mocked ruthlessly by the crowd after the competition. Contestants can always yield in a contest if they wish, although this does not lessen the mockery. Most of the contests are timed by the use of a large and extravagant water clock kept in the nobles’ palisade to the east of the coliseum.</p><section class=\"milestone\"><article><p><strong>First-Place Win</strong>: If the PCs win first place in a contest, they earn 2 Tournament Points, 80 XP, and 80 Kingdom XP.</p><p><strong>Second-Place Win</strong>: If the PCs win second place in a contest, they earn 1 Tournament Point, 40 XP, and 40 Kingdom XP.</p></article></section><p>The rules for each contest are outlined in the following pages.

The PCs could simply stumble upon Whiterose Abbey as they’re exploring, but with the proper foreshadowing and implied threat, a visit to Whiterose can be much more than an extra-detailed hex encounter.</p><p>King Irovetti knows that the PCs are the heart and soul of their kingdom. If the PCs can be eliminated, he reasons, their kingdom will fall all the easier to his armies. Yet Irovetti knows that, having deceived the PCs once already, he’ll need to be far more subtle if he hopes to get them to investigate Whiterose and expose themselves to the dangers that wait there.</p><p>Irovetti hopes to lure the PCs into his trap by tricking someone he thinks the PCs will listen to into believing false tales of a new threat to their kingdom. Perhaps this information comes to the PCs from someone they already know, or perhaps it comes from someone new to the PCs, such as an NPC working for Mivon or another River Kingdom who wants to get into the good graces of the PCs. You can choose any NPC other than @UUID[Actor.XzFifthQr0V5nEJe] to pass this information on to the PCs—not only should Ilora remain a source of trustworthy information, but King Irovetti can’t use her because he doesn’t know where she is.</p><p>One elegant way to introduce the information engineered to get them to investigate Whiterose is as the result of the PCs taking an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.NPUQJAt6lzBGRPZf] kingdom activity to try to learn something about Pitax. On a <strong>success</strong>, you can supply the PCs with the disinformation, but on a <strong>critical success</strong>, you should inform the PCs that something seems off about the intelligence. It’s still worth investigating, but in this case, the PCs should know beforehand that they might well be walking into a trap.</p><p>The PCs could also learn the information from an officer they capture and interrogate. Irovetti has informed several of his key commanders of the ambush for the PCs he’s set up at Whiterose, and by giving his commanders a convenient bit of information to give up under the duress of an interrogation, they might gain mercy from the PCs even as they’re sending them into a trap.</p><p>The nature of the lure is simple: Irovetti wants the PCs to believe that he has developed a way to create a massive <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.MlpbeZ61Euhl0d60]</em> effect using a modified <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.hcGvN03ieNWlSQYa]</em>, the talents of a master poisoner from Daggermark, and a mystical font said to lie within the abandoned Whiterose Abbey. The truly devious part of Irovetti’s plan is that even if the PCs learn that there is no actual “horn of cloudkill,” the rumors of his interest in Whiterose—or perhaps merely the rumors of a font that can enhance poisons, drugs, and potions—will likely be enough to reel the PCs into the trap.</p><section class=\"quest\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>The Poison Plot</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>30 XP</li></ul></header><article><p>The PCs learn of a plot by King Irovetti to create a poison-spewing magical horn.

Among these, two warmongers rise to lead legions against the Stolen Lands: Coclavlis the Iron Wizard, heir to many secrets of Numeria’s ageless lore, and the mercenary lord Angdrathus, whose ties to the Technic League of Starfall have granted him an army and weapons like no other.</p><h3>THE OUTLAW COUNCIL</h3><p>With the solidification of their realm, the PCs receive word from Raston Selline of Mivon inviting the rulers of the Stolen Lands and their retinue to an upcoming meeting of the River Kingdoms Outlaw Council. But do the lawless lords of that wild country actually seek to invite a new ruler into their midst, or is this meeting of merciless despots merely a stage for assassination and warlike aspirations? And might the masterminds of such schemes be the PCs themselves?</p><h3>THE ROSTLAND REVOLUTION</h3><p>King Surtova watched nervously as his nation’s southern frontier turned from a lawless land to a new nation. With Pitax’s fall, it seems the PCs’ kingdom threatens to become an empire in its own right. Refusing to let Brevic lands slip through his grasp and appear weak in the face of rebellious Rostlanders, he sends one of the nation’s Talon Armies to the southern border and demands the PCs’ surrender. Can the PCs defend their nation from their own fatherland? And will their act of defiance stoke the flames of revolution in Brevoy?</p><h3>VENGEANCE OF THE FALLEN</h3><p>During the course of this campaign, the PCs faced numerous enemies. As events play out in your game, keep track of those enemies who escape, as these can provide you with exciting opportunities for future adventures. What better hook for a new generation of PCs than to face off against a Stag Lord, a troll king, or an ageless barbarian warlord returned to seek vengeance against the kingdom whose rulers defeated them once before?</p>"

They may even be content to rule this “kingdom in a bottle,” but the knowledge that they are nothing more than a glowing grain of sand in a chalice may soon drive them to seek a way to escape. In time, the Lantern King forgives Nyrissa and allows the thousand kingdoms she’s captured to transform into her new realm in the First World—but the time between the PCs’ kingdom being absorbed into the Apology and this event is flexible, and how it changes their reality is left for you to decide.</p><p>Alternatively, the PCs could be left behind when their kingdom is taken. If this occurs, the region known as the Stolen Lands is immediately transformed into a lifeless desert—the rivers that once flowed through the region are quickly absorbed by the thirsty sands. This event causes much panic in neighboring kingdoms— particularly Brevoy and Pitax, whose borders now lie uncomfortably close to a wasteland.</p><p>The method by which the Stolen Lands can be restored is up to you, but it likely requires a journey into the First World, perhaps even the attention of the Eldest.

If you opt for this simple solution but are using the kingdom management rules from Appendix 3, then at the start of any Kingdom turn during which warfare took place, the kingdom gains [[/gmroll 1d6]] Unrest and increases one Ruin of the party’s choice by 1 point.</p><p>But if you want to expand the kingdom rules to include a method of resolving mass combat in play as downtime events, read on!

                            "text": "<p>In a war encounter, the focus is on a clash between opposing armies on the field of battle. These rules don’t work particularly well when an army attacks a single target—such encounters are better played out with the PCs facing the threat themselves.</p><p>But what if the PCs want to fight with their soldiers on the field of battle? For the most part, a PC who fights in an army won’t noticeably affect that army’s stats. Having a famous (or infamous) founder of the kingdom fighting at your side in battle can bolster an army’s mindset, though, so if a PC chooses to fight in this way, they grant a +1 status bonus to that army’s Morale checks.</p><p>A better way to incorporate PCs in battles is to have them confront specific singular enemies on the field of battle while the armies themselves fight it out all around them. In such a case, play out the war encounter to its completion to determine the degree of success achieved (see Victory or Defeat in @UUID[.Sz7W36dIfOpzuRth], then play out the battle between the PCs and their foe(s). If the PCs win this battle, the result of the war encounter is improved one degree, but if the PCs lose their battle or the enemy escapes, the result of the war encounter is worsened one degree.</p><h3>Powerful Magic</h3><p>Some spells and magic items, particularly at higher levels, could potentially have significant effects on the outcome of mass conflict. For example, a fireball can burn many targets at once. Earthquake can not only destroy large portions of a battlefield, but they can potentially devastate entire armies. And powerful monsters like dragons can simply fly above an army and rain down devastation in the form of breath weapons. The rules presented here do not allow for this level of interaction between individual characters and full-scale armies, but you can allow it if you wish.</p><p>In cases where the PCs wish to use powerful magic to help resolve potential war encounters, feel free to let them automatically defeat armies that are 5 levels or more lower than the party’s level—this represents the PCs using their resources to defeat trivial foes, and the PCs shouldn’t earn XP for such a tactic. Of course, most of the armies the PCs encounter in this adventure will be close to their own levels, so such methods aren’t appropriate. In these cases, the easiest solution is to simply give the PCs a +1 to +2 circumstance bonus to any war encounter checks they make to represent the advantage they have using this magic. Alternately, powerful spells can simply alter the landscape of the battlefield—see @UUID[.rhaj7QWAk7jbONA3] on for more details.</p><p>Note that if you allow the PCs to do this, consider allowing NPC enemies the same for their forces as you see fit.</p><aside><h3>Traveling with an Army</h3><p>Normally, armies move through the Stolen Lands during Kingdom turns via the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.ysKkyZp02RMujObE] activity, but if the PCs wish to travel with armies during hexploration—a particularly wise choice during the War of the River Kings—they can do so. In this case, when the PCs come across a non-army encounter, assume the PCs’ forces hang back while the PCs play out the encounter in encounter mode as usual. When the PCs encounter an army, they can engage it with their own army in a war encounter. If the PCs leave an army during hexploration, that army remains in its hex until the PCs return to guide it in hexploration mode again or until they move it with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.ysKkyZp02RMujObE] activity during a Kingdom turn.</p></aside>"

These strategy-scale maps are designed to serve the needs of both the Warfare and Settlements subsystems, and can be found in the linked compendium.</p><p>The maps cover a variety of environments and terrain types, allowing you to choose one that corresponds best to the surrounding environment. For example, for a battle in Hooktongue, you might choose a map with swampy terrain, criss-crossed with streams. When you've found the map you want to use, just import a fresh copy into your world by dragging it to the scenes tab of your sidebar, or by right-clicking on it and pressing \"import\".</p><header class=\"split\"><p>Macro</p><p>@UUID[Macro.tBNClHcSG86qstrp], @UUID[Macro.vhSPQfDfEAEQzXzz]</p></header><p>If you want to get even more variety out of these maps, you could consider rotating or flipping the scene's background tile with the above macros. This could allow you to adjust the map to more closely match the surrounding area- for instance, ensuring that a battle happens on the correct bank of a river- or just to inject new life into a scene your players may have seen before.</p></section><p>Armies can move across the battlefield to engage enemies, to retreat and regroup, and seek terrain advantages during their war actions, but their relative positions on the battlefield remain abstract throughout the encounter. What does matter is relative position between armies. During a war encounter, armies can be in one of the following three relative positions. Two of these positions—engaged and distant—are also @UUID[.3sgmiSFT7UVikm6s].</p><p><strong>Near</strong>: When war encounters begin, the armies involved are normally considered near—close enough to advance and engage with a foe, but far enough to avoid direct conflict. An army cannot attempt melee Strikes against an enemy that is near—only ranged Strikes. Indicate an army is near by placing its token on the grid in any square not adjacent to another army.</p><p><strong>Engaged</strong>: An army that is engaged can attempt melee Strikes against other armies it is engaged with. Indicate armies that are engaged with each other by placing their tokens adjacent to one another. An army can be engaged with up to four armies at once.</p><p><strong>Distant</strong>: An army that attempts to disengage or retreat can move to a distant point on the battlefield. Attacks on a distant army are possible via ranged Strikes, but at a –5 penalty for the range. Indicate a distant army’s position by placing its token or miniature on the table just off the edge of the grid. (Armies that manage to flee the battle entirely are taken off the table.)</p><h3>Battlefield Terrain Features</h3><p>While some battles take place in open terrain, some battlefields contain additional terrain features. Relatively common battlefield terrain features are detailed below; some of the scripted war encounters in the Adventure Path feature other, specific terrain features.</p><p><strong>Darkness or Heavy Fog</strong>: All armies become concealed, and distant armies become undetected. Armies in these conditions take a –4 circumstance penalty on Scouting checks. Armies with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.y1JGtzGmMtVh5USK] ignore the terrain effects of darkness.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: A war encounter that takes place in rugged mountains, swampland, or dense forests are examples of difficult battlefield terrain. Armies take a –2 circumstance penalty on Maneuver checks in difficult terrain.</p><p><strong>Dim Light, Light Fog, or Rain</strong>: Armies in these conditions gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Maneuver checks and take a –2 circumstance penalty on Scouting checks. Distant armies become concealed. Armies with low-light vision or darkvision ignore the terrain effects of dim light.</p><p><strong>Wind</strong>: Ranged Strikes take a –1 circumstance penalty in strong wind, or a –2 circumstance penalty in windstorms. The penalty for a ranged Strike on a distant army is doubled to –10 (this penalty stacks with the standard penalty to ranged Strikes in wind).</p><h3>Fortifications</h3><p>Some battlefields include a fortification (such as a keep, castle, wall, or trench) that can house one or more armies. An army can’t seek defense in a fortification once a battle begins; it must prepare itself and its defenses in advance during a @UUID[.kwEHLYvBIECJ2xkX] via the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.iYLFBep0kddHQkW9] activity. Once an army is successfully garrisoned, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.c8lNjzrY2WM60Zsv] condition as long as it avoids using Maneuver war actions.</p><p>It’s possible to destroy a fortification, but only with the use of siege armies. If a fortification is destroyed, all armies that were fortified within lose that condition and increase their @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.7LMDwpVijK7x5Jst] condition value by 1.

This ritual uses numerous dangerous components, such as spores from yellow mold, and is a risky magic to work, yet the Cult of the Bloom still manages to spread this evil ritual’s effects throughout the Stolen Lands, putting the PCs’ kingdom into peril.</p><p class=\"Sidebar_Sidebar-Body-indent\">As <em>monstrous bloom</em> is not intended to be a ritual the PCs can learn, and all of the after-effects of the ritual are quantified as needed in Chapter 5, the ritual itself is not presented in detail here. Methods by which the PCs can learn more about the ritual and how to combat its effects are detailed in @UUID[JournalEntry.Kmwzfr7NS9r9Vhb0.JournalEntryPage.JmhxqlHTRQJymnx4].</p></div><div id=\"_idContainer072\"><h3>The Apology</h3><p class=\"Sidebar_Sidebar-Body\">This powerful artifact appears as a chalice filled with glowing grains of sand, each of which represents one of the 999 kingdoms Nyrissa defeated and absorbed prior to the beginning of this adventure. The <em>Apology</em> exists primarily as a story element, as the PCs lack the skill and time to use it to absorb kingdoms of their own. It won’t be long after the PCs finally gain this artifact that the Lantern King destroys it, unleashing the horrors of the Lantern Kingdom (see Part 2 of @UUID[JournalEntry.fGmovu4cjIsUnACs]). A character who wishes to research the Apology’s powers can do so by making a DC 45 check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.eReSHVEPCsdkSL4G], but this only reveals maddening hints as to how it can be used to absorb kingdoms. A critical success reveals that only the Apology’s creator, the Lantern King, can destroy it.</p></div>"

If its partner goes too long without fighting, the sword misleads its wielder into believing they’re the real Armag and that anyone around them who isn’t obviously a member of their lineage or following is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear as those of the original Armag. If left unchecked, these powers seemingly bring the warlord back to life—it’s the wait for this subtle transformation to be complete that’s kept the current “Armag” in meditation in the tomb for so long. The long-term effects on a PC as a result of this curse are left to the GM to adjudicate, but at the very least should result in a gradual shift of the PCs’ alignment to chaotic neutral. If 24 hours pass without Ovinrbaane being used in an encounter of at least moderate difficulty, its partner becomes irritable and short-tempered, and is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg] until the end of their first turn in a moderate or more difficult combat.</p><p>Ovinrbaane is a <em>+2 striking wounding greatsword</em>.

How one can find their own gravestone in the Boneyard when they have yet to die and be judged, of course, can be a complex problem to solve, perhaps requiring the destroyer to first die, be judged, sent on to the afterlife, and then be restored to their original mortal life through the result of an epic quest by allies or the whims of a deity.</p><p class=\"Stat-Blocks_Stat-Body-indent\">Alternately, if Ovinrbaane is left unused for a hundred years, its magical powers grow dormant. At this time, the weapon can be destroyed normally, although it still has Hardness 30 and 120 Hit Points, and at the end of any round during which it is not destroyed, its dormant powers awaken again if it succeeds at a DC 5 Flat Check. Since the blade is currently active, this option doesn’t present a particularly viable one for PCs seeking the artifact’s destruction during the course of the Adventure Path—although sealing it away in a vault could be an excellent first step in this process, entrusting the final destruction of the dangerous artifact to some future generation of hero.</p>"
