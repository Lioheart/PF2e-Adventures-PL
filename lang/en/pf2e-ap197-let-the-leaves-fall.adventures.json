            "description": "Cut off from the rest of the world by a sinister curse, the people of Willowshore face the daunting possibility of a winter on their own. Stockpiling food, preparing for the change in seasons, and dealing with an increasing number of supernatural events take up the heroes' time as they work to make sure Willowshore is ready to face winter, but the true test lies along the ancient pathway leading west out of town. By taking this so-called Pilgrim's Path, the heroes of Willowshore can travel to an ancient monastery that, they hope, will contain clues as to how to defeat the curse. Yet what dwells now in the ruins may not part with its secrets willingly…",

As the weeks roll on, though, strange supernatural events begin to trouble townsfolk, and the need to look beyond the Wall of Ghosts for answers becomes unavoidable. </p> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>Chapter 2: The Enlightened Path</span> </h2> <p> The PCs devise a ritual to open the Wall of Ghosts and, upon stepping through, set foot upon the Pilgrim’s Path: the traditional meditative journey from Willowshore to the Tan Sugi monastery, where they hope answers await. The curse extends here, however, and with even greater power. Before the PCs finish the journey, they’ll face supernatural storms, monstrous threats, and haunted shrines. </p> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"> <span>Chapter 3: In the Ruins of Wisdom</span> </h2> <p> The Tan Sugi monastery lies in ruins, but worse, it’s also in the grips of fiendish monsters and undead monks who have turned their backs on tradition. In order to learn valuable secrets about the nature of the curse afflicting their town, the PCs must purify the monastery and defeat the evil that has taken root within. </p> <aside class=\"float-right\"> <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Let Them Fight!</h1> <p> While Chapters 2 and 3 of this adventure feature plenty of classic combat and exploration, the first chapter of “Let the Leaves Fall” is focused entirely on a wide range of downtime activities the PCs must pursue in their quest to prepare Willowshore for winter and to learn more about the curse afflicting the town. As such, there are few opportunities for combat during the bulk of this adventure’s timeline, with the events of Chapters 2 and 3 potentially filling only a few weeks. While some groups will welcome the chance to roleplay and pursue downtime activities, you might find your group is eager for a fight now and then. In this case, you can add encounters with dangerous creatures in the wilds, or even a potential raid from a monster or group of monsters against a location in town. You can also adjust some of the hauntings found in the later part of Chapter 1 into combats against undead if you wish. </p> </aside> <section class=\"advancement-track\"> <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Advancement Track</h1> <p>“Let the Leaves Fall” is designed for four characters.</p> <p> <span class=\"level\">4</span> The PCs begin this adventure at 4th level. </p> <p> <span class=\"level\">5</span> The PCs should be 5th level before they attempt to walk the Pilgrim’s Path. </p> <p> <span class=\"level\">6</span> The PCs should be 6th level before they explore the Tan Sugi monastery. </p> <p>The PCs should reach 7th level by the time they complete the adventure.</p> </section>"

Rumors held that the tallest of these trees was the reincarnated spirit of an ancient hero named Tan Sui-Jing, who defeated a powerful fiend named Kugaptee, and Zhi Hui hoped to see this magnificent example of the cycle of life with her own eyes. When she arrived, the power she felt in the remote grove astounded her, and she knew that the towering tree at the center was of great spiritual significance. After meditating at the tree’s base for 10 days, she decided she needed to build a monastery in the grove so that others could make the pilgrimage, then remain there to help preserve the site from harm. </p> <p>Willowshore was founded that same year, for Zhi Hui needed a place to live for those who would help build the monastery. For the first few years, little work was done at the Tan Sugi grove (as Zhi Hui had taken to calling the site), for the establishment of Willowshore took up most of the pilgrims’ focus. As Willowshore grew, Zhi Hui focused on creating the path between the new town and the sacred site. She knew that while the journey to the grove through the rugged terrain could be traversed by the hasty in less than a day, rushing the trip robbed the traveler of the chance to shed the distractions of day-to-day life, and so Master Zhi Hui sought to create a pilgrim’s trail that would be traversed over the course of three days of patient introspection and self-reflection. </p> <p>Thus, Master Zhi Hui traversed a path through the forest, choosing each footstep with intention. As she made her way through the woods, she found herself climbing up and over steep slopes, winding through seemingly-identical stretches of forest where one could easily lose their way, and skirting the shore of a large lake with a mirrorlike surface before reaching the Tan Sugi grove. The creation of this path—the laying of its stones, the building of a footbridge, and the construction of small shrines and buildings to serve as way stations—would take her and her followers the better part of a year to complete.</p> <p>The creation of the Tan Sugi monastery took several more years. Every timber and every stone was chosen and placed with careful consideration. It would be 10 years before the monastery was completed, but in that time, Master Zhi Hui’s disciples grew. To them, Zhi Hui’s guidance was like a single autumn leaf alighting upon their minds—gentle yet arriving with the weight of a well-lived life, and always allowing the disciple the freedom to choose their own path. By the time the monastery was completed, dozens of pilgrims were making yearly treks to Willowshore to undertake the journey to the Tan Sugi monastery.</p> <p>But soon after Zhi Hui passed away from natural causes in 7054, discord crept into the lives of the adherents of the Tan Sugi monastery. The arrival of newcomers to the monastery dwindled, then reversed as monks began leaving in search of enlightenment elsewhere. What none of the monks would ever learn or even suspect is that upon Master Zhi Hui’s death, one of their own fell from grace. This monk was named @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19707advent.JournalEntryPage.07xinyue00000000], and his memories of past lives remained unusually strong. Xin Yue’s grief poisoned them enough to allow the influence of Kugaptee, whose remains lay buried and unguessed at by most of the monastery’s occupants, to creep into his soul. It was largely the subtle manipulations of Xin Yue that helped the discord to flourish among the monks.</p> <p>By 7060, what few monks remained at the monastery had become corrupted by Kugaptee, and when Xin Yue offered themself as a sacrifice to the fiend, only to reincarnate before the other monks’ very eyes, they felt that the truth of the Tan Sugi monastery had been revealed—this place wasn’t one for quiet reflection and peace, but a cage-tomb in which a great power that would give them all rewards for service had been imprisoned for centuries. </p> <p>These corrupted monks cut ties with Willowshore, and for the next two years, the people of Willowshore assumed that the monastery had been abandoned when, in fact, Xin Yue and their followers now spent their time exploring a way in which they could free Kugaptee from his grave. Simply chopping down the sugi tree that grew over Kugaptee’s remains would only release the fiend’s soul into the Great Beyond—Xin Yue knew from his visions that what Kugaptee wanted was to instead reincarnate into the mortal realm, and to do so, the sugi tree needed to remain intact to serve as the raw materials for his new incarnation. Kugaptee wished to use what remained of his old enemy, Tan Sui-Jing, as his method of reincarnation into the world. In order to achieve such a goal, though, Xin Yue and the monks needed to spend decades in meditation and prayer to prepare the way. </p> <p>In 7062, a group of woodcutters sent from the city of Sze came to Willowshore seeking a hidden sugi grove. They marched up the path to the Tan Sugi monastery, intent on harvesting its trees, only to be slaughtered by the monks. The bodies of the woodcutters were then used to perform a grand conjuration of nindoru fiends, which were subsequently sent down to Willowshore with a warning. Wearing the bodies of the slaughtered woodcutters and wielding their broken weapons, the resulting horror became known as the Night of Broken Blades, and from that date onward, the people of Willowshore frightfully ensured that no one else would ever dare visit the Tan Sugi monastery. </p> <p>And so things went, until Governor Heh Shan-Bao made his disastrous attempt to remove the corruption growing into Tan Sui-Jing’s sugi tree, a ritual that backfired and resulted in the deaths of everyone in town—and in the Tan Sugi monastery as well. When the mindscape was created, the region surrounding the monastery, including the entirety of the pilgrim’s path leading to it, became engulfed within a Wall of Ghosts, and the monks who dwelled within died and rose as undead. As part of the mindscape, Xin Yue and their followers know that they’ve been repeating the years over and over but have been powerless to break free. Many secrets and revelations about the nature of the mindscape thus lie in wait for Willowshore’s heroes to discover, yet the threats they’ll encounter in the Tan Sugi monastery beyond the Wall of Ghosts will be the greatest dangers they’ve yet faced.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>It’s fall in Willowshore, and as the leaves begin to turn, the summer rains are replaced by crisp autumn breezes, yet the end of the unusually rainy summer and the defeat of the monsters that had menaced the region bring the townsfolk little comfort. New leadership has been put in place, but the mystery of what happened to Governor Heh Shan-Bao (and his manor, for that matter), missing since the first day of summer, continues to perplex. However, even more worrisome is the strange curse that surrounds the region, one that prevents anyone from traveling too far from Willowshore and also seems to prevent anyone from neighboring settlements from visiting. Only one mysterious merchant, a strange man named Shinzo, seems able to come and go to Willowshore, and even he is unsure of why and has no insight into the curse’s nature. As the days march forward into fall, one thing becomes clear: if the people of Willowshore are to survive the coming winter, food must be stored and reinforcements must be made so that the townsfolk can survive the seasonal storms to come.</p> <p>While the locals can continue to stockpile firewood, pickle and ferment food for long-term storage, fortify structures against the cold, and store grain for safekeeping, there’s only so much they can do on their own without aid and without inspiration. Fortunately for Willowshore, the townsfolk aren’t alone in this plight—they have a band of heroes at their side to help prepare them for the worst!</p> <p>This adventure begins on the first day of fall. Give the party time to rest and recover from the events of the previous adventure, but when you’re ready to begin this adventure (preferably within a few days of the first day of fall), the party will be contacted by the town elders with an invitation to meet at the Willowshore Trade Office to discuss the town’s immediate future.</p> <p>When the PCs arrive, they’ll be greeted by the town elder who now serves as Willowshore’s governor, along with the elder who lost that bid for leadership, <strong>Zheng Peng</strong> (LN male human watch officer 3, representing the town guard and Willowshore’s need to physically prepare for winter), and <strong>Nadoya Sanmi</strong> (NG female human family matriarch 3, representing Willowshore’s farmers and the need to stockpile food and supplies).</p> <p>While you can roleplay out this meeting if you want, summarizing the important points listed below can help get the adventure started quickly. The meeting begins with the town elder thanking the PCs for all they’ve done to help Willowshore so far but then noting that the work has only begun. The elder asks the PCs to continue to research the nature of the curse afflicting the town, but adds that it’s more important to make sure that Willowshore is ready for winter at this point; the town has only three months before food and shelter will become its most important resources. In light of this need, the town elder asks the PCs to aid in the following three ways.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Townsfolk Morale:</strong> The town elder observes that the townsfolk are growing worried and fearful of the future, so whatever the PCs can do to keep spirits high and spread hope will be appreciated. An excellent way to do so would be to rebuild and reopen the Cerulean Teahouse to the public as a traditional place to relax and gather (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02restoringthe00]), but taking part in the festivities for First Long Night on the 22nd day of the month might be an even better way to keep spirits high (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02week3firstlo00]). Beyond these options, the PCs should be ready to provide help and aid to the townsfolk as needed in order to improve morale.</li> <li><strong>Food Stores:</strong> Nadoya Sanmi notes that as long as the people of Willowshore remain trapped in the curse, food stores are important to build. She can suggest several activities the PCs can pursue to help Willowshore prepare for winter (see Gathering Food on page 10) but remains very concerned by the simple fact that Willowshore has always relied on trade to supplement its food supplies, and without that option available, the town’s farmers and hunters are going to be hard-pressed to meet the upcoming demand.</li> <li><strong>Storm Preparation:</strong> Zheng Peng tells the PCs that he has asked the town guard to help with repair work and storm-proofing of buildings, but he would be grateful if the PCs can help in other ways to ensure Willowshore is ready for the coming winter (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02increasingse00]). While the summer’s rainstorms were excessive, they’re still nothing compared to the powerful winds, thunder and lightning, torrential downpours, and even periodic snowstorms that Willowshore expects to face in the coming months.</li> </ul> <p>Anything the PCs can learn about the curse afflicting the town will help, and if they can determine any clues as to how to lift the curse, the town elder wants to hear about such information as soon as possible—but not at the expense of the three more immediate concerns above (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02researchingt00]). With the ledger the PCs recovered from Zoudou at the end of the previous adventure, they’ve got an excellent lead on where to go next, but interpreting Zoudou’s notes will take time and work. If the PCs struggle with the text, the town elder suggests the PCs pay a visit to three locations in particular for aid: the herbalist You So-Jin at Graveside Manners (who has lived in Willowshore longer than anyone else and might have insights others have missed), the wizard Igawa Jubei at Mother’s Coil (where the largest amount of old texts in Willowshore are stored), and Great Willow (the kodama who helped the PCs in the previous adventure determine the scope of the region’s curse).</p> <p>The meeting adjourns soon thereafter, allowing the PCs to begin the work of preparing for winter as they see fit. With the exception of First Long Night, which take places on the last day of the third week of fall, the order in which the PCs work on these tasks is left to them—wise PCs don’t focus on one category but instead spread their efforts across them all. The remainder of this chapter covers the wide range of downtime activities the PCs will face during these efforts. Even after the PCs learn how to defeat the Wall of Ghosts and make their journey to the Tan Sugi monastery in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19703theenl] and @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther], they can continue to pursue the downtime activities in this chapter up until the end of fall, when this adventure ends.</p>"

While the people of Willowshore assume this appointment will be temporary and hope that missing Governor Heh Shan-Bao will return soon, such an event won’t occur during this Adventure Path. This adventure assumes that the PCs supported either Old Matsuki or Granny Hu to take on the role, but in your game, another NPC (or perhaps even one of the PCs themselves) might have taken on the role. Who exactly runs Willowshore is largely irrelevant, though, and in this adventure, that character is referred to as the “town elder.” If a PC leads Willowshore in your game, choose a significant NPC in town the party has allied with to instead play the role of adviser and quest giver in this adventure.</p> </aside> <p>Full details of the town of Willowshore are presented in <em>The Summer That Never Was</em>, the first adventure in the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path.

As time marches on, the days grow shorter and more overcast. Light rain might fall for a few hours twice a week or so, and blustery breezes grow more common as the leaves begin to turn, but overall, the weather during this adventure should certainly be bearable, if not actually pleasant. In the final few weeks, days remain overcast and a thin layer of frost replaces the morning dew as winter looms.</p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform: scale(1)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-199-season-of-ghosts/assets/art/mm_logo_blue.svg\" alt=\"MetaMorphic Digital\" title=\"MetaMorphic Digital\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Scene Notes</span><span class=\"keepme\">Ambiance</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Playlist.F9fuytDxR5FAcEmZ.PlaylistSound.uRtx9UywbenbCVSy] @UUID[Playlist.F9fuytDxR5FAcEmZ.PlaylistSound.wWrsqg5V97RRaccy]</span> </div> </section> <p>When this Adventure Path began, Willowshore was a 4th-level settlement, but at the end of the previous adventure, the bravery and actions of the PCs bolstered town morale and helped get several locations damaged by the monstrous invasion repaired; as a result, Willowshore is a 5th-level settlement when this adventure begins.

It’s likely that the PCs are at least admired by one of Willowshore’s factions when this adventure begins, and they should have opportunities during this adventure to earn enough additional points to become revered by one of the factions by this adventure’s conclusion. Reputation, along with any Preparation Points the PCs accumulate (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02preparingfor00]) will help determine how the people of Willowshore fare in the next adventure. </p> </aside> <p>In order to prepare for winter, the PCs must work to accumulate three different categories of Victory Points, referred to in this adventure as Preparation Points: Hope Points represent the townsfolk’s attitude and morale, Food Points track Willowshore’s food stores, and Security Points track the town’s infrastructure and supplies for enduring the winter. The amount of points </p> <p>the PCs accumulate during this adventure for these categories will determine how Willowshore endures the dreadful events to come in the next adventure. At the same time, the PCs can research the curse afflicting the town as they work to learn more about the situation they all find themselves in.</p> <p>All of the methods by which the PCs can accumulate these three categories of Victory Points play out as special downtime activities that have the preparation trait.</p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform: scale(1)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap196-199-season-of-ghosts/assets/art/mm_logo_blue.svg\" alt=\"MetaMorphic Digital\" title=\"MetaMorphic Digital\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Scene Notes</span><span class=\"keepme\">Point Tracking Effects</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Item.QZVvkkQc72Rx4l99] @UUID[Item.uSoSx6JqJg4gAaog] @UUID[Item.0hExucpRxmoLmZ7x]</span> </div> <p>Add these to the Point Tracking actor in book 1 to keep track of Preparation Points.</p> </section> <p>Downtime in this adventure is measured in weeks, with up to four individual PCs being able to attempt one preparation downtime activity each week. If your group has more than four PCs, the additional PCs can Aid other PCs’ preparations. A PC can also pursue one additional non-preparation downtime activity each week if they wish, choosing from standard downtime activities like Craft, Earn Income, or Retraining as well as attempting Research checks to research the curse.</p> <aside class=\"float-right\"> <h2>Preparation Awards</h2> <p>The first time the PCs reach 12 points in each of the three categories of Preparation Points, the party earns 40 XP, for a total of 120 XP if they earn at least 12 points in all three categories. In addition, each time the PCs reach 12 points in one of these three categories, they gain 1 Reputation Point to the faction of their choice.</p> </aside> <p>The point at which the PCs can begin Chapter 2 is determined by their accumulation of Research Points (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02researchingt00]), but once they decide to do so, they won’t be able to pursue downtime activities during any week—partial or full—they spend in pursuit of this adventure’s second and third chapter goals. Since most parties shouldn’t need more than one or two weeks to play out those chapters in exploration and encounter mode, they should have plenty of time to build up Preparation Points.</p> <p>As the PCs prepare, they’ll also face weekly events that they’ll need to take part in—see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02willowshoree00] for more details. In particular, let the players know that First Long Night will take place at the end of week three. Full details on this festival are covered in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19705firstl], and the event itself is detailed on @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02week3firstlo00]. During week three of this adventure, preparations for First Long Night give the PCs an additional way to earn Hope Points.</p> <aside> <h2>Tracking Preparation Points</h2> <p>Keep track of the points the PCs accumulate during this chapter in a visual way so that the players have a constant visual reminder of their progress. Once you begin the third adventure in Season of Ghosts, all three of these categories of points are “spent” as winter’s weeks proceed. </p> <p><strong>Hope Points:</strong> The party starts this adventure with 3 Hope Points. Of the three categories of Preparation Points, Hope Points are the most likely value to be periodically reduced during play. Inform the players that as long as they have a positive value for Hope Points, the townsfolk are productive and morale is high. The higher the value they can build, the better, but there isn’t a specific number the PCs should know to aim for. If a week begins with negative Hope Points, all skill checks to earn Preparation Points take a –1 circumstance penalty as aid and cooperation from townsfolk diminishes. The PCs can earn Hope Points by completing weekly town events, by building up their teahouse (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02restoringthe00]), or by taking part in First Long Night festivities and events (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02week3firstlo00]). </p> <p><strong>Food Points:</strong> If Old Matsuki serves as Willowshore’s leader, his foresight gives the town a leg up here, and the party starts with 3 Food Points—otherwise, the party starts with 0 Food Points. The harvest season is only now beginning, and most of Willowshore’s citizens haven’t yet started to store food. Let the players know that if the PCs can secure at least 12 Food Points by the end of fall, Willowshore will reach the minimum amount of food stores needed to endure the winter—but earning more than 12 points will certainly help against unforeseen events and give the town a valuable cushion against potential starvation.

Preparing for winter in Willowshore involves repair work to roofs, weatherproofing walls and buildings, training in how to respond to emergencies with things like fire and flood drills, and other civic preparations.

The teahouse’s previous owner, Qing Mai-Lai, found the cat as a kitten, curled up in the cooling embers of a campfire while she was walking through the village. Thinking the cat was black, she named it Yami, but upon giving it a proper cleaning, the cat turned out to be a light cream with brown leopard patterns. The name Yami stuck, and the cat became one of Mai-Lai’s most </p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/art/PZO90197 YAMI.webp\" alt=\"female bakeneko\" title=\"Yami\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/art/PZO90197 YAMI.webp')\" /> <p>loyal companions, watching over the teahouse from the shadows while occasionally warming the laps of guests.

In truth, she’s a bakeneko—a magical creature awakened when a cat lives an unusually long life. Before the events that thrust Willowshore into its mindscape, Yami had already started her transition into a bakeneko. With the mindscape’s repeating years, she has only grown stronger while retaining the same small cat form, yet she retains her feelings of admiration for the villagers (who have always treated her kindly no matter how differently events have played out each yearly cycle). Yami, like the villagers, doesn’t recall the events of previous cycles, but she does recognize she’s much more powerful than she should be given her age and experience—a feeling that grows stronger with each passing year.</p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Actor.QN16LZTm8EwDUsXG]</span><span>Creature 3</span></h2> <p>Female @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19707advent.JournalEntryPage.07bakeneko000000]</p> </section> </aside> <p>The following downtime activities can be pursued to restore the Cerulean Teahouse.</p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Repair and Restore</h1> <ul class=\"traits\"> <li class=\"trait\">Downtime</li> <li class=\"trait\">Manipulate</li> <li class=\"trait\">Preparation</li> </ul> <p class=\"no-indent\">You spend the week cleaning, repairing, and restoring the Cerulean Teahouse.

Further, the ruins of the Tan Sugi monastery lie beyond this wall, and if this site can still be reached, the lore and libraries within will be invaluable in learning more about the curse itself. Construction on the Tan Sugi monastery began back in 7020, the same year Willowshore was founded, but the monastery was abandoned in 7062, and much of its lore was lost or forgotten. </p> <p><strong>4 Research Points</strong> The noppera-bo who dwelt in the abandoned lumber camp seemed to believe a “paradise” awaited them beyond the Wall of Ghosts, but perhaps the truth is something else entirely? Others among them worshipped something named “Kugaptee”—a name that sounds familiar but that likely requires more research to learn more about.</p> <p><strong>6 Research Points</strong> The name Kugaptee is associated in certain old texts with the Tan Sugi monastery and was the name of a powerful nindoru fiend defeated hundreds of years ago by a hero named Tan Sui-Jing.

Perhaps more information about Kugaptee—including the possibility that the curse might be associated with the fiend—still resides within the abandoned monastery walls?</p> <p><strong>8 Research Points</strong> Before the Tan Sugi monastery was abandoned, the monks performed daily rituals to ensure the health of the sugi trees, but now that the place has been left to fall into ruin, the most likely source of the curse seems to be Kugaptee’s influence seeping out into the region—particularly given the fact that the monastery appears to be hidden inside a cursed shroud of its own.

This is an opportunity for your PCs to get some roleplaying time in with their favorite Willowshore NPCs. Read through @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19705firstl] to help present the festival for the PCs, perhaps taking time with each PC to determine how they wish to dress for the festival. </p> <aside class=\"float-right\"> <h3>Spirits and Hauntings</h3> <p>As the PCs make their preparations for winter and tend to the teahouse, strange rumors begin to spread among the villagers and frightening events interrupt their daily chores. These supernatural events grow more common as the weeks go by, replacing the more mundane weekly events. Each time one of these supernatural events occurs, reduce the number of Hope Points the PCs have accumulated by 1, as these unsettling events erode morale and spread fear through town.</p> <p>The townsfolk see these events as evidence that the curse afflicting the town is growing in power, and you shouldn’t dissuade the PCs from believing the same. In fact, these events are the results of attempts in the modern world, led by lumber baron Mago Kai, to exorcise the spirits that linger in modern Willowshore, a truth the PCs will discover (and fight back against) in the next adventure.</p> </aside> <p>Note that the description of First Long Night in the section following this adventure assumes the celebration takes place in the modern era, after a century or so of jorogumo rule. Few changes to these traditions take place for the PCs, though, who exist in a timeline at the dawn of this new order in Shenmen. For the most part, fears about jorogumo in particular for the people of Willowshore should instead be fears about the curse afflicting the town, perhaps with some even hoping that a successful First Long Night will help lift the curse in some way.</p> <p>The festival primarily takes place on the town square in downtown Willowshore, but smaller celebrations and events and feasts occur throughout the town. The bulk of the celebrations play out over a 6-hour span from 6:00 p.m. to midnight. During this time, the PCs can each take part once in the three traditional contests held during First Long Night, as detailed on page 62.</p> <p><strong>Admiring the Moon:</strong> If at least one PC earns 4 Victory Points in the Admiring the Moon contest, the party earns 1 Hope Point. Any PC who earns 6 Victory Points while Admiring the Moon wins an alchemical elixir for their victory, chosen from the following three options: a moderate cognitive mutagen, a moderate serene mutagen, or a moderate silvertongue mutagen.</p> <p><strong>Bundle-Cutting:</strong> If at least one PC earns 4 Victory Points in the Bundle-Cutting contest, the party earns 1 Hope Point. Any PC who earns 6 Victory Points while Bundle-Cutting wins their choice of a <em>striking weapon rune</em> or a <em>ghost touch weapon rune</em> for their overwhelming victory. </p> <p><strong>Lantern Making:</strong> If at least one PC earns 4 Victory Points in the Lantern Making contest, the party earns 1 Hope Point. Any PC who earns 6 Victory Points while Lantern Making wins three lesser elixirs of life for their overwhelming victory. Unlike the other two contests, the Lantern Making contest is a single event that can have only one grand prize winner. If no PC earns at least 6 Victory Points, then the winner is <strong>You So-Jin</strong> (NG female elf herbalist 4) of Graveside Manners. If a PC earns 6 or more Victory points, the PC who earns the most Victory Points is the grand prize winner. In the event of a tie, the grand prize is split evenly. The grand prize itself is a silk pouch containing several pearls and gems worth a total of 100 gp.</p> <p><strong>Reward:</strong> Regardless of how many contests the PCs win, the party earns 1 Hope Point for taking part in First Long Night as well as 120 XP. If the PCs win at least 1 contest, they gain 1 Reputation Point to the faction of their choice. If they win all three contests, they gain 1 Reputation Point to both Southbank and Northridge.</p> <h3>Shinzo’s First Visit</h3> <p>The mysterious merchant Asahina Shinzo (in actuality, a powerful but exiled servitor of Pharasma known as a shinigami who appears in this adventure as a human man) pays a visit to the town during the festival along with his strange raven companion, Yix. As in the previous adventure, Shinzo should be enigmatic but friendly, and while he won’t directly take part in any of the festivities, he does seem to enjoy watching the townsfolk’s revels. As before, his cart of supplies should be tailored to serve the PCs’ interests. You can create a list of items for the PCs to shop through, filling his cart with a dozen items of a level no higher than the party’s level, or you can allow the players to “place orders” for items that will be available for purchase upon Shinzo’s next visit.</p> <p>During First Long Night, though, Shinzo gets into the festivities and offers his items for sale at a 10% discount (this discount doesn’t apply to items the PCs place orders for).</p>"

As this week begins, she starts finding clumps of hair dangling from the ceiling of her shop that reappear each morning no matter how often she cleans them up. At first, she assumed the culprit was a mischievous kami or children playing pranks on her—at least until today, when her customers all bit into their steamed buns only to spit out clumps of hair mixed in with their fillings. Distraught, Mama Bao closes her shop and seeks out the PCs for help, asking them to come back to her shop to help solve the strange mystery by spending the night and seeing if they can catch the culprit.</p> <p>Upon arriving at Mama Bao’s shop, the PCs can swiftly confirm that all of the buns prepared the evening before have had hair mixed in with their fillings. A @Check[perception|dc:14] check confirms that the hair strands are all around the same length and came from the same head.

Although the PCs won’t be able to learn this truth at this time, they’ll be able to take steps to appease the haunt.</p> <p>The ghost haunting Mama Bao is that of Hinode Akari, a young woman who left Willowshore in search of a life of adventure, only to have her life cut short when she ran into Mama Bao’s grandfather outside of town just two days into her journey. He had heard that a dollmaker in the city of Sze paid handsomely for long hair to use for his dolls, so he killed Akari, plucked each strand of hair from her head, and sold it to the dollmaker for enough money to last his family through the winter and open a small steamed bun shop.</p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform: scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/mini/PZO90197%20Writing_hair-MINI.webp\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Haunted Hair</span> <span class=\"keepme\">Low 4</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.wCl6qfFfiuycloYw]</span> </div> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/art/PZO90197 Writing_hair.webp\" alt=\"the ghostly form of a young woman with long hair\" title=\"Hinode Akari\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/art/PZO90197 Writing_hair.webp')\" /> <p><strong>Hazard:</strong> Akari lingered for decades where she had been murdered, but when exorcists begin to work their magic on modern Willowshore, her spirit becomes agitated enough to lash out at her killer’s unsuspecting granddaughter. Despite her tragic story, Akari’s haunting presence is initially more of an unnerving inconvenience than an actual threat, but that changes when the PCs stay overnight in the shop. The PCs are thus the first to spend the night in the shop after it becomes haunted.</p> <p>An hour after midnight, the ghostly form of a young woman with long hair drifts into the shop through one of the doors, then proceeds to pull out her hair by the roots. She holds out handfuls of hair, and they slither through the air like worms to infest tomorrow’s steamed buns and to form strange, braided patterns tangled in the rafters. If the PCs take no action, the haunt completes its uncanny rite after a minute before it fades away. After seeing the spectral image, a PC can attempt a @Check[willowshore-lore|dc:21] check (or can attempt a @Check[diplomacy|dc:21|traits:exploration,skill,secret,action:gather-information|name:Gather Information] check the next day to Gather Information) to recall an old story about a young woman’s corpse that was found near Gourd Lake with every hair on her head plucked from her scalp. The woman was later identified as a local herbalist named Hinode Akari. If the PCs mention this tale to Mama Bao, she grows pale and then curses in shock as the pieces fall into place. She reveals that a few nights before the body was found, her grandfather came into a sudden windfall of money which he used to build the steamed bun shop. He told her parents that the money came from selling “an old collection of wigs to a puppet maker in Sze,” but now Mama Bao recalls how evasive grandfather had been and suspects the awful truth.</p> </section> <p><strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs defeat or disable the haunt, the party earns 1 Hope Point. If the PCs discovered the haunt’s story, Mama Bao promises to see to it that Hinode Akari’s memory is honored to atone for her grandfather’s cruelty, and the party earns 1 additional Hope Point. In addition, for helping a downtown business, the PCs earn 1 Reputation Point with Northridge if they defeat or disable the haunt.</p>"

An elderly villager died from the flu the previous night; the corpse went missing sometime </p> <p>later that same evening, “as if it just walked away on its own.” She suspects that You So-Jin, the elven herbalist who minds Graveside Manners, animated the body with some sort of “alchemical concoction” but doesn’t have any proof one way or the other.

The actual perpetrator is none other than Yami, the bakeneko who has taken up residence in the PCs’ teahouse. For many months, the necromantically-curious bakeneko has resisted the urge to animate a zombie, but her resistance finally broke down this week. She used <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.c3b6LdLlQDPngNIb]{Create Undead}</em> to animate the corpse of an elderly woman who often left food out for Yami while she lived. Yami sees her animation as repaying a favor but understands that locals might not see it the same way, so she has had the zombie shambler remain in hiding in the bushes behind the teahouse.</p> <p>If the PCs successfully track the zombie to the bushes behind their teahouse, they’ll find it deep in the shrubbery, crouched down and waiting patiently for Yami to return—it glances up at the PCs when discovered but doesn’t move, attacking only if it’s attacked first. As soon as the PCs discover the zombie, in any event, Yami quickly approaches to stand next to her zombie, then decides it’s time to confess her role in the shenanigan. </p> <p>If the PCs have already befriended Yami (@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19702turnin.JournalEntryPage.02restoringthe00]), they might have already discovered the truth about the bakeneko, but regardless, Yami asks the PCs to let her “keep” the zombie, explaining that it dances well in the moonlight (and even orders the zombie to dance as a demonstration). Yami understands if the PCs want the zombie to be returned to death and brought back to the church, but stubbornly hopes the PCs will let her keep it. To convince Yami to let her zombie go, the PCs must succeed at a @Check[diplomacy|dc:21] or @Check[intimidation|dc:21] check. If the PCs have already befriended Yami, they improve the result of their check by one degree of success.</p> <p>If the PCs destroy the zombie or otherwise take her away against Yami’s wishes, or if they use Intimidation to get her to agree, the bakeneko grows surly and abandons Willowshore.

This exorcism causes that individual to vanish from Willowshore as well, the first “true death” to hit the mindscape in its 115 years. This villager won’t return if the mindscape resets but neither does their soul move on to enter the River of Souls—they’re instead banished to an awful, hidden mindscape buried “behind” the Willowshore mindscape, a place where Kugaptee’s influence is that much stronger.</p> <p>Choose the villager to vanish from among those the PCs have befriended, but avoid choosing one whose role has become significant to a specific character.

Yet, this aspect is far from the most unsettling quality of the wall, for within the mist, ghostly shapes churn and float into and out of sight. Every now and then, one draws close enough to the edge to reach out an arm or to press a face against the mist—acts that distort those limbs and visages into feral, monstrous caricatures of humanity, before some unseen force within the mist yanks them back into the foggy depths.</p>"

Before they set off on the journey, though, make sure the players are familiar with commonplace lore about the monastery and the Pilgrim’s Path. This information is presented to the PCs in the <em>Season of Ghosts Player’s Guide</em> as well.</p> <aside class=\"no-toc\"> <h1>Common Knowledge</h1> <p>The Tan Sugi monastery was founded by a Sangpotshi monk named Zhi Hui in 7020 and was built around an ancient sugi tree said to have mystic properties. Willowshore was originally founded to support those who built the monastery and the long trail that leads to it, also known as the Pilgrim’s Path. Zhi Hui passed away in 7054, and as the monks of the monastery began to drift away, Willowshore shifted focus to the lumber industry. By 7060, the monastery had been fully abandoned, but when a group of woodcutters attempted to harvest the ancient sugi trees that grew there in 7062, tragedy struck. The woodcutters returned to Willowshore with broken weapons and ruined bodies, and while the undead woodcutters were defeated by morning, dozens of townsfolk perished to their battered tools. The event is remembered today as the Night of Broken </p> <p>Blades, and few visitors have made the journey to the ruined monastery in the 46 years since. The place is regarded as cursed, haunted, or worse, yet there are those in town who can’t help but wonder what treasures and lore might still lie abandoned in the ruins.</p> <p>The monastery is located in a secluded valley many miles to the west, surrounded by steep mountains. The only safe path to and from the site is the Pilgrim’s Path. While the last stretch of the trip to the monastery from Willowshore along the Pilgrim’s Path is only a 13-mile hike, traditionally those who would seek knowledge made the trek slowly, pausing to spend the night three times at three shrines along the way. These shrines—one on a floating platform in a lake, one near an ancient dead tree, and one on a secluded, rocky perch overlooking the path below—represented the traveler’s past lives, their future lives, and their current life. By turning the short hike into a multiday meditative trip, the seeker of knowledge and enlightenment adopts a mindset better suited to receiving the teachings of the monks of the Tan Sugi monastery.</p> </aside>"

In order to reach the ruined monastery, they must spend those four days and three nights following the Pilgrim’s Path traditions. Consider having Shinzo pay a visit to Willowshore just before the PCs set out in order to give them a last chance to purchase supplies; if a PC had items on “order,” then they should be available at this time, regardless of how much time they expected to have to wait.</p> <p>Once the PCs step through the Wall of Ghosts and begin their trip, they’ll soon realize that reality is even more confined here than in the Willowshore hinterlands. The Pilgrim’s Path (and the Tan Sugi monastery complex detailed in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther]) are the only regions accessible in the mindscape. A character who leaves the Pilgrim’s Path and travels into the surrounding wooded mountains finds themselves returning to the Pilgrim’s Path not long after losing sight of the trail, having been turned around without noticing the change in direction. This even affects flight; a character who flies higher than 120 feet finds themselves veering back downward, but not before noting that fog obscures clear line of sight over the treetops beyond a half mile or so. As long as the PCs remain on the Pilgrim’s Path, though, they can travel unimpeded in either direction.</p> <p>Another curiosity is that travel along the Pilgrim’s Path can’t be rushed. No matter how fast or how slow the party moves, they’ll reach the next waypoint shrine after 8 hours of travel (or the monastery itself on the fourth day of travel). This distortion of distance is even more noticeable if the PCs travel back toward Willowshore, for no matter how many days along the Path they’ve traveled, returning to the Wall of Ghosts entrance never takes more than an hour. Previously passed shrines are mysteriously skipped on a return trip, and the next time the party enters the Pilgrim’s Path, they must start their trek over from the beginning, revisiting each shrine in succession. Notably, the status of each shrine remains as it was the last time the PCs visited; encounters don’t “reset,” and items left or alterations made to the shrines persist.</p> <p>A PC who experiences these strange effects can attempt a @Check[occultism|dc:20|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge; on a success, they come to the conclusion that the Pilgrim’s Path is a more constrained version of the same curse that contains Willowshore and its hinterlands, and they realize that what’s happening on the Path could indicate that a deeper revelation about the nature of the curse does await discovery at the Tan Sugi monastery.</p> <p>The weather along the Pilgrim’s Path isn’t in sync with that in the greater Willowshore mindscape, and instead changes by the day along the journey. If the PCs retreat to Willowshore and start their walk up the Path over again, they’ll experience the same weather on each day of the journey.</p> <p>Unless otherwise indicated, the forest surrounding the Pilgrim’s Path is difficult terrain. The map of the Willowshore hinterlands on the inside of the front cover of this book shows the route that the path takes as well as where several of the encounters occur during the journey.</p>"

For the first half of the day spent traveling, the path winds through dense forest, while the route traveled in the afternoon curves along the eastern shore of Mirror Lake. Here, as the PCs look out over the lake, they can see all the way to the opposite shore as well as the mountains beyond.

This kappa, whose name is Enko, was tricked by a storm hag named Iogaka into spilling the water in his head bowl when she told him to beg for his life on his hands and knees. Thoroughly entertained by the kappa, Iogaka picked the terrified Enko up and flew into the air with him in her clutches, cackling with cruel delight and dropping him off near the Wall of Ghosts, far from any source of water.</p> <p>Far from his home in Mirror Lake, Enko has been painstakingly making his way back home with his 5-foot speed to refill his head bowl with water, but now and then cries out in fear and waves his arms as a slight breeze wafts by. This “breeze” is Iogaka’s voice, carried via voice of the storm, and she issues tormenting whispers to Enko as she promises to pick him up and drop him off “at the edge of the world” over and over whenever he gets back to his home.</p> <p>Upon spotting the PCs, Enko drops down on his hands and knees and begs for mercy. He apologizes for getting in the PCs’ way and crawls pitifully to the side of the path to let them pass, but doesn’t attack or even look a PC in the eye. Enko is frightened and wary; as a result, his initial attitude is unfriendly. If made hostile, he doesn’t attack but instead just faints from fear. If made at least indifferent, Enko explains his plight, hoping that the PCs aren’t Iogaka’s agents. Now and then, more whispered taunts reach Enko’s ears, causing him to cry out in fear. A PC who leans in close can hear Iogaka’s torments with a successful @Check[perception|dc:15] check. Fortunately, the storm hag has no way to tell that Enko might have just met allies—her voice of the storm ability is one-way only.</p> <p>Enko only wants to get back to Mirror Lake, and if the PCs offer to escort him, he can’t believe his luck. In fact, he remains wary and nervous until he’s back in the water, at which point his attitude toward the PCs becomes friendly. If the PCs refill his head bowl with water before reaching the lake, he’ll become helpful. Without this mercy, the PCs might need to carry him if they want to make it to Mirror Lake (and the Bridge Shrine) by nightfall; at such a slow speed, the mindscape’s distance-distorting effects don’t allow the PCs to cover that much ground in a day.</p> <p>If the PCs assist Enko, he thanks them over and over to the point of near absurdity. If the topic of Iogaka comes up, he also warns the PCs that the “storm mother” is a terrible and frightening monster who can hurl lightning and blasts of wind that can strip flesh from bone. Enko isn’t sure why Iogaka took to tormenting him recently, but if he’s at least friendly, he’ll tell the PCs that she’s got a particular and strange distaste for the scent of burning incense—a weakness that Enko warns is tough to take advantage of, given Iogaka’s mastery over wind.</p> <p>Enko is, like the PCs, a trapped soul in the mindscape and has no insights into the nature of the curse other than to note that here, the edges of the curse seem to follow the Pilgrim’s Path. Though he laments that he can’t do laps across the lake anymore, he has mostly acclimated to his new (if lonely) life along the shore.</p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Actor.Pt1mwZXzlwfMm1of]</span><span>Creature 2</span></h2> <p>Male Kappa</p> </section>"

A hexagonal wooden shrine stands in the center of the river, its roof providing shelter from the elements while also offering a viewing portal in the center to allow those in the shrine to contemplate the flow of water below. Several long-handled dippers for bringing up draughts of river water for drinking lean against the central hole’s railing, along with a half-dozen delicate-looking clay vials.

Rather than build something grandiose, she had a simple rope bridge constructed over a point in the river, then erected a hexagonal wooden pagoda at the center to help anchor the bridge. This pagoda is the first of the Pilgrim’s Path’s three shrines—a place where travelers could take shelter mid-crossing and gaze through an opening at the platform’s center to contemplate the river’s flow below.</p> <p>Zhi Hui felt that time spent along the shore of Mirror Lake provided an opportunity for self-observation and reflection. She hoped that pilgrims, when stripped of the distractions of others and the mundane problems of daily life, might see in their reflections a true vision of who they are when unburdened. To aid in this, each pilgrim would chant a repetitive prayer meant to invoke the cycle of reincarnation, then retire to sleep above the gently flowing waters.

In 7098 (10 years ago, from the PCs’ perspective), Yeri’s big sister, Yuni, convinced her to sneak out of town and walk along the Pilgrim’s Path on a dare to check out the abandoned monastery. Foolishly, they left town in the afternoon and didn’t bother to walk the path slowly. As night fell, the two sisters were attacked by a horrifying monster—a penanggalan.

If asked about the beads, she says she inherited them from her mother, and as the one thing she has to remember her by, they’ve always brought her comfort. She keeps her high-collared jacket wrapped tightly around herself, claiming that she’s cold if the PCs ask, but a PC who succeeds at a @Check[perception|dc:22] check catches a glimpse of a faint scar that curls all the way around her neck.

The rock pathway leads up to it, with this last stretch flanked by three pairs of unlit stone lanterns.</p> <p>While traversing this leg of the journey, Master Zhi Hui was delighted to find a grove of wildflowers, berries, and wild radishes growing in an idyllic clearing here. The floral beauty and the delicious taste of the fruits and root vegetables made an excellent spot for a shrine, where pilgrims could enjoy a simple meal and contemplate the values of enjoyable repasts at the end of a day of travel while also ensuring that they did not overindulge in food or drink.

The stone path offers solid footing, but anyone who steps off the path finds that the ash-caked mud is difficult terrain. The six stone lanterns that flank the path at area <strong>C3c</strong> are meant to burn cone-shaped incense, and offer enough protection to allow such burning even in a rainstorm. </p> <p>When the PCs first arrive, the place appears to have burned relatively recently. The cottage (area C3b) is badly burned, but enough of the roof remains intact to offer at least some shelter from the rainstorm. The garden shrine itself is located in the stone building in the back (area <strong>C3d</strong>), the contents of which survived the fire intact. In addition to a modest shrine, additional supplies for upkeep and repair were stored here. A character can use these supplies to patch up the roof and walls in the main cottage with a successful @Check[crafting|dc:18] check and an hour’s work (failure indicating that the supplies were ruined in the attempt). Once these repairs are made, the PCs can sleep in area <strong>C3b</strong> comfortably; otherwise, when they awaken the next day, the damp causes them to rise @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued} for the day unless they succeed at a @Check[fortitude|dc:15] save. </p> <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> Unlike the Bridge Shrine (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19703theenl.JournalEntryPage.03b3bridgeshri00]) and the Mountain Shrine (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19703theenl.JournalEntryPage.03d3mountainsh00]), the Garden Shrine once had keepers to tend to it. Four caretakers dwelled here, shrine tenders who took great delight in providing travelers with a comfortable place to stay at the approximate halfway point to the Tan Sugi monastery. The caretakers enjoyed providing meals and comforts for pilgrims, but after the monastery was abandoned, the group opted to stay on, living as hermits who would periodically offer shelter to the odd trapper or hunter. This all came to an end in 7062, when the woodcutters sought out the Tan Sugi monastery. The caretakers tried to turn the woodcutters away but were unsuccessful... and when the woodcutters returned along the path that evening as undead monsters, they lit the Garden Shrine on fire. </p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform: scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/mini/Combusted.webp\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Garden Shrine</span> <span class=\"keepme\">Moderate 5</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.do9yYgYcj4qLQFbY]</span> </div> <p>The shrine’s four caretakers perished in that fire and now exist as undead guardians.

About an hour before sunset (and the PCs’ arrival at the ruined monastery), they’ll come to the end of the Pilgrim’s Path, where a small shrine stands next to a plain wooden arch that looms over the path. As the PCs approach, the chill in the air suddenly abates. As a comforting fall warmth settles over the area, the sound of singing birds and chirping cicadas fills the air, and even the scent of the surrounding forest grows more vibrant and soothing.</p> <p>Master @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19707advent.JournalEntryPage.07zhihui00000000] spirit senses the PCs’ approach, and while her ghost remains trapped within the monastery for now, the fact that the PCs have walked the Pilgrim’s Path gives her a chance to reward them, depending on how many of the three shrines the PCs have managed to achieve enlightenment at.</p> <p><strong>Fewer than Three Shrines:</strong> The PCs feel that some unseen force is disappointed in them. They understand that they should retreat along the path to seek enlightenment at the shrines they missed. Upon returning to these shrines, give them more insight into how to achieve enlightenment in the form of additional visions or mysterious urgings from beyond. They can continue to progress toward the monastery instead if they wish but do so without the rewards below. </p> <p><strong>All Three Shrines:</strong> If the PCs have achieved enlightenment at all three shrines, they feel a sense of welcoming pride but also an unmistakable sense of peril at what lies ahead. In addition to these feelings, the PCs also experience an urge to investigate the small shrine alongside the path. If they do so, they find within the shrine several potent magic items—gifts manifested here by Zhi Hui’s power, in much the same way that Kugaptee’s greater presence has manifested so many monsters in the mindscape.</p> <p>This volume’s Adventure Toolbox presents several different magical items: @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19707advent.JournalEntryPage.07pilgrimagegi00].

Nestled in a thickly forested dormant caldera, the monastery was built around the tallest tree in the region—the same tree that grew from Tan Sui-Jing’s body over the grave of her nemesis, the nindoru Kugaptee. The monastery’s creators cleared away several trees but incorporated this tall sugi tree, as well as nine smaller ones, into the monastery’s design then proceeded to decorate the walkways and wooden buildings surrounding the grove with motifs of nature. Depictions of plants, animals, and various spirits were carved into the wooden walls and stone foundations of the monastery, and small shrines dot the southern courtyard to provide shelter for visiting spirits. A gate at the southern side of the monastery welcomes visitors, but the pathways laid throughout the grounds are now mostly overgrown by thick, spiky weeds. The six wooden buildings that make up the monastery have tall tiered roofs that arch to a height of 40 feet, but at nearly a hundred feet, the central sugi tree more than doubles this height, looming properly over the entire compound.</p> <p>The monastery was designed not only to house monks but also as a place for pilgrims to come and meditate. The central path leads to the main hall, where monks and visitors gathered daily to pray and meditate, while five outbuildings served the monks as living quarters and other facilities. When Master Zhi Hui first built the monastery, she wanted to create spaces throughout the grove for observation, meditation, and introspection unique to the Tan Sugi monastery.</p> <p>Today, the monastery is in ruins. The once well-maintained courtyards are overgrown with weeds. Mud and fallen leaves litter the walkways, </p> <p>and holes in the roofs and walls have allowed the rain to damage most of buildings’ interiors. After the devout monks abandoned the monastery in the wake of their leader’s death, those who remained fell under Kugaptee’s influence, and when the region was transformed into a mindscape, those monks died as well. Unlike the PCs and the citizens of Willowshore, though, the monks rose as undead minions of Kugaptee and now serve at the whims of the nindoru fiends who rule the ruins.</p>"

Bones, dead leaves, and chunks of mummified flesh lie in heaps around the statue, whose missing head appears to have been hewn off by a single blow. Bloodstained, moldy ropes have been wrapped tightly around the statue, amid which many more old bones with bits of dried meat have been affixed.</p> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/art/PZO90197 PHARASMA STATUE.webp\" alt=\"Pharasma Shrine\" title=\"Pharasma Shrine\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/art/PZO90197 PHARASMA STATUE.webp')\" /> <p>The monks of the Tan Sugi monastery followed the teachings of Sangpotshi, but they erected this statue of Pharasma here out of respect for the role she plays in the cosmic cycle of life and death. The nindorus hold no such respect and defiled this statue on the very first day of summer after they appeared in the monastery. With a successful @Check[religion|dc:10|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge, a PC can identify the headless statue as depicting Pharasma; with a critical success, they confirm that the nature of the statue’s defiling is meant to represent a fundamental rejection of her power over life and death, indicating that she’s blind to the truth of it and powerless to change her ways.</p> <p>The statue is one of the four that must be purified in order to gain access to Kugaptee’s grave and speak to Zhi Hui’s ghost. Before this process can be started, the creatures in this chamber must be defeated, and the statue’s missing head (found in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e13thetansug00]) must be placed atop the stump of the statue’s neck. Upon successfully purifying the statue, the head mysteriously reattaches itself, as if it had never been hewed free in the first place.</p> <p><strong>Creatures:</strong> When the PCs enter, creatures who appear to be three robed monks kneel before the statue, as if in prayer. These monks are, in fact, sojiruh nindorus, and rather than praying, they’re meditating on the futility of Pharasma’s presence in the multiverse and preparing to ritualistically rebind the statue in a fresh coil of rope they’ve placed on the ground before themselves. If the fiends notice the PCs, they rise up and turn to face them, their stitched mouths twitching unnervingly as they greet them. The sojiruhs are eager to find out why the PCs have come to the shrine and work to convince them that the idea of life after death is a myth. “After death, there is only us!” they promise, offering to kill the PCs to prove their points. You can use these fiends to reveal bits of information about the monastery (such as that the monks who remained are now all undead, that they’re led by someone named Xin Yue, or even that the ghost of the monastery’s founder is imprisoned here), but it shouldn’t be long before the fiends grow weary of conversation and issue a challenge to the PCs. </p> <p>The challenge is simple. The PCs are to run a circle around the central courtyard, moving from this room to area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e1grandgate000], then to area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e7kitchen00000], area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e6refectory000], area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e3mainhall0000], area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e4infirmary000], and finally back here. The nindorus know that dangers are likely to oppose the PCs’ passage through many of these areas but nonetheless tell the PCs that if even one of them can make their way through this circuit before the nindorus can complete the rebinding of Pharasma’s defiled statue, they’ll reward them with a valuable treasure. </p> <section class=\"encounter\"> <div class=\"header\"> <img style=\"transform: scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/mini/PZO90197%20sojiruh-MINI.webp\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Pharasma's Shrine</span> <span class=\"keepme\">Low 6</span></h2> <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.VoZLYBwdAZU3LqPv]</span> </div> <p>The nindorus don’t care if the PCs actually run the race honestly or cheat; should the PCs leave during this challenge, upon returning to this room, they’ll find the three nindorus haven’t even started rebinding the statue.

These treasures include a lesser tome of <em>restorative cleansing</em>, several scrolls (a <em>scroll of entangle fate</em>, a <em>scroll of life’s fresh bloom</em>, a <em>scroll of prophet’s luck</em>, a <em>scroll of sacred nimbus</em>, a <em>scroll of tomorrow’s dawn</em>, and a <em>scroll of wall of mirrors</em>; all of these new spells are detailed in this volume’s Adventure Toolbox), and a large book bearing the title <em>Watchers of the Cycle</em>. The first half of this book contains hundreds of short parables and stories culled from a wide range of religions, each curated for the lessons they can impart to a follower of Sangpotshi. If a character references this book while researching any topic relating to Sangpotshi or reincarnation, they gain a +1 item bonus to any Sangpotshi Lore or Religion checks to Recall Knowledge. The second half of the book contains the formulas for several rituals, including <em>gnaw at the moon</em>, <em>last night’s vigil</em>, <em>ransack the night</em>, <em>regale the lost ones</em>, and <em>sweetest solstice</em> (all of these rituals are detailed in this volume’s Adventure Toolbox.) The final pages of the book contain the formula for the ritual <em>reincarnate</em>. <em>Watchers of the Cycle</em> is worth 90 gp. </p> <p><strong>Reward:</strong> If the PCs speak with Yen Rui and manage to learn what she knows, grant them 120 XP.</p>"

To the monks of the Tan Sugi monastery, the concept of being reincarnated as a plant, as Tan Sui-Jing was, represented a specific form of enlightenment, and when a monk died, they were buried in the planter boxes here so their remains could nurture the plants their spirits hoped to reincarnate into. Once a body was reduced to bones, those bones were exhumed, powdered, and then sprinkled back into the soil. In this way, the monks hoped to bolster Tan Sui-Jing’s vigil over Kugaptee’s grave. Perhaps a grim tradition to some, to the monks (who believed that once the spirit moved on from the body, a new body awaited them), the remains left behind after death were simply a relic of the past. This place once had potent magical effects to help give the plants here a place to grow and thrive despite being indoors, but those effects quickly faded once the monastery was abandoned.</p> <p>The abandonment of the monastery and its fall to those corrupted by Kugaptee manifests within this chamber physically, for the beautiful, hearty, and nutritious plants that grew here have been replaced by diseased weeds and parasitic fungi.

The creatures consist of two slime molds (mindless predators that still attack with an unsettling sense of cruelty, preferring to seek out lower Hit Point targets) and six chaotic evil fungus leshies, each of which incorporates fragments and pieces of bone into their malformed, barely-humanoid-looking bodies.

Glistening coils of rot and decay spread up from several of the tree’s roots to wind along its trunk, while many branches above are thick with immense spiderwebs.

The decay spreading up from the roots starts in an underground chamber below (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e16kugaptees00]); while it has reset every year for the past 115 years, Kugaptee’s growing influence as the result of Mago Kai’s meddling in the real world has accelerated the process—if the PCs don’t put a stop to it, by mid-winter, the Tan Sugi tree will fall, and Kugaptee will escape, an event that will destroy the entire mindscape, absorb the souls trapped within (including the PCs) into Kugaptee, and release the powerful fiend into the modern world.

The first time the PCs enter the courtyard, the spider lurks in the branches above, visible at a height of 50 feet but motionless for the moment. Down below, squatting among the tree’s roots as it gnaws and chews at the bark, is an unsettling figure—an undead kitsune dressed in rags. This individual was one of Xin Yue’s most loyal followers, a horticulturists monk who forgot his name as well as much of his previous life when he was reborn in the mindscape as a kurobozu. Now, the undead monk simply refers to himself as the Chewer, as he has taken it upon himself to gnaw at the sugi’s roots in an attempt to quicken its decay.

As the PCs arrive, the kurobozu is entertaining itself by playing fetch with the hell hounds, using a well-chewed human skull for the game. Upon spotting the PCs, the hell hounds immediately bare their teeth and growl menacingly, but the kurobozu holds out a rotting hand to stay their attack, then proclaims that “it’s rude to interrupt someone’s idle moments. Why are you here? Why should I not feed you to my pets?”</p> </section> <p>If the PCs don’t immediately attack, they’ll find this nameless kurobozu somewhat eager for conversation. Potential answers to some questions the PCs might pose are listed below, but after answering a few, the kurobozu grows weary and, with a snap of its fingers, sics the hounds on the party. Once combat begins, they fight until destroyed.</p> <p><strong>Who are you?</strong> “I can’t remember, but it doesn’t matter. I serve at Xin Yue’s whim, and she serves the great Kugaptee.”</p> <p><strong>Why are there so many corpses here?</strong> “Leftovers. Food. Decoration. What other use do corpses have? If you mean what are we doing with the bodies before they become corpses, though, well, Xin Yue needs fresh flesh and warm blood to sate Kugaptee, to provide him with strength so that he may rise from his grave. Are you here to volunteer your meat and juices?”</p> <p><strong>Who is Xin Yue?</strong> “She is our focus, our reason, our purpose. Great Kugaptee bid us to follow her so we do. She has only killed and offered souls to Kugaptee since we arrived. I think. She’s quite unpleasant to be around. You must think that’s quite disturbing coming from someone like me. You’ll understand when you meet her.”</p> <p><strong>Who is Kugaptee?</strong> “We can arrange a meeting. Just hold still...” (At this, it orders the hounds to attack.)</p> <p><strong>Prisoner:</strong> When Xin Yue took over after the monastery was mostly abandoned, she and her followers used of some of this chamber’s storage alcoves as improvised prisons for captured sacrifices, usually wandering hunters or explorers who stumbled upon the ruins.</p> <p>When the mindscape formed, this room’s sole prisoner, a small-time thief named Kalen Bray, perished along with the other monks, yet he did not rise as a kurobozu. Instead, he rose as a zombie that retained his memories from life—and each time the mindscape cycle resets, those memories remain. Over the past 115 years, Kalen has lost track of just how many times things have reset, and his damaged memories have merged so that he simply believes he’s languished here “forever.”</p> <p>In life, Kalen hailed from Absalom, and he came to Shenmen solely to plunder items to sell to collectors throughout the Inner Sea Region. After hearing of the abandoned monastery, he made his way over to survey the grounds, only to be captured by Xin Yue’s monks. The monks initially intended to sacrifice him in a few weeks, but when the mindscape formed a week after Kalen’s capture, his new undead state rendered him useless for such a purpose, and so they’ve simply left him here to literally rot.</p> <p>Kalen has so many memories of escaping his cell only to be slaughtered by nindorus that he’s long since given up trying to escape. He’s since learned that it’s best to remain still and “play dead.” Once the PCs defeat the kurobozu and its hell hounds, Kalen stirs from his torpor and calls out to the PCs from the northwesternmost alcove, where he is chained to the floor with manacles. “Well, this is new! People who aren’t monsters? Who might you be?”</p> <p>Kalen Lies to the PCs, claiming to have been a hunter who took shelter in these ruins during a storm only to be captured by the evil monks who live here, and asks the PCs to defeat the monsters that now live in the ruins above so he can finally escape. With his vague memories, he can give the PCs some maddening and confusing clues—telling them that he and the monks who dwell here became undead at the same time “many, many years ago,” but he can’t remember why. In fact, until the PCs’ arrival, he’d come to believe that all life had perished in the world.</p> <p>Kalen is evil, but not particularly dangerous, and if the PCs help him escape he won’t cause much additional mischief in the region—instead taking to a life lurking in the woods and eventually running afoul of a monster that finishes him off. He’s not bothered by his undead appearance, stating, “It’s nothing some new clothes and a mask can’t hide.” In return for promising to let him out, he reveals to the PCs the location of the stash of treasure he hid in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e8storage00000]. </p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Actor.vLnbFLcQXCyFPfEJ]</span><span>Creature 2</span></h2> <p>Male husk zombie</p> </section>"

A shimmering form made from bloody mist and shadows coils up from the center of the cave to tower over the PCs, a shape that never quite settles on one form, reaching out with multiple arms and demonic heads atop coiling stalks. And then, a moment later, the entire cavern suddenly seems to shrink around the PCs. A sense of vertigo, as if suddenly being lifted up into the air, causes stomachs to lurch while the surrounding roots grow smaller but more numerous. The roots wrap around the form of Kugaptee, shrouding it and cutting off the roar. A moment later, the PCs find themselves in a cramped, root-filled cavern barely large enough for them all to stand in. No sign of Kugaptee’s fingers remains, and Xin Yue’s dead human body (and her gear) lies on the ground, finally at peace. The fiend’s grave has been restored, and the immediate threat he poses to Willowshore is no more.</p> <p>The stairs leading back up to area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19704inther.JournalEntryPage.04e15treasurec00] are much shorter. When the PCs return to the surface, they find the monastery still in ruins, but the presence of all the undead, monsters, haunts, and nindorus has vanished. More importantly, the Tan Sugi tree now stands healthy at the monastery’s core, with no spiderwebs or diseased streaks in sight. Zhi Hui’s ghost appears before the PCs one last time, thanking them for their service. This exchange will be the last opportunity the PCs have to speak to her, so allow them enough time to get any final answers from her they can. In particular, the PCs should know now that Willowshore isn’t cursed but is a cyclic mindscape that keeps repeating the same year over and over after the town’s governor tried (and failed) to perform a ritual meant to further protect everyone from Kugaptee. Now that the PCs have put things right in the monastery, the threat from Kugaptee has been removed, but they remain trapped in this mindscape with no knowledge of how long they’ve repeated the same year. If the PCs haven’t explored the Hidden Library and recovered its valuable books, Zhi Hui can lead them to this location as well.</p> <p>Once the PCs have finished speaking to Zhi Hui, her spirit fades away, merging (for now) with the Tan Sugi tree. If the mindscape resets, everything starts over, but if the PCs can break the mindscape, Zhi Hui’s soul will finally travel to the afterlife.</p>"

The people of Willowshore are eager to hear about the PCs’ adventures and what they’ve learned about the curse as well, but the knowledge that the town isn’t cursed but trapped in a mindscape could confuse or even distress the townsfolk, especially when it becomes apparent that the PCs haven’t actually found a solution for the problem.

The revelation that something else entirely is causing these haunts remains a mystery that the PCs shall confront and investigate in the next adventure, culminating in their discovery that Willowshore’s ex-governor has become trapped in a mindscape of his own. And the greatest and most staggering discovery yet—that the governor’s failed ritual not only created a mindscape, but killed the entire town and trapped its inhabitants within for over a century—will soon be made clear as the cold months of winter take Willowshore into its grasp!</p>"

These preparations are organized around rural families’ observation of First Long Night, an evening spent together in solemn commemorations of deceased kin as well as witnessing the community’s hopeful aspirations.</p> <p>While First Long Night speaks to the autumn equinox, it isn’t uncommon for pre-festivities to begin a fortnight or two before. Such a practice has its roots in local adaptations of Tian-Shu religious traditions; since the imperial Yixing, adherents of Pharasma and Sangpotshi originally set various dates in early autumn for paying respects to the dead and making peace with one’s mortality.</p> <aside class=\"float-right\"> <h1>In Willowshore...</h1> <p>Note that much of this article explores how the festival of First Long Night exists in the modern day. During this volume’s adventure, the impact of over a century of rule under the jorogumo isn’t as much a factor in how the festival’s traditions have grown. The adventure has advice on how these changes might affect some of the celebrations and traditions where the lack of 115 years of jorogumo rule wouldn’t apply.</p> </aside> <p>First Long Night is a very physical event, even before the date of the festival arrives. As anticipation builds, locals work more exuberantly in hopes of getting ahead of duties so as to have time to prepare for the festival, working to the tempo of resonant folk songs with the lyrics and cadence often containing insights into traditional farming techniques or local legends. Fall’s crisp breeze carries the scent of wood-smoked preserved meat and rendered lard as townsfolk prepare food stores, while the noise of construction for temporary festival grounds goes on well into the evening. Everything is vivid, loud, and fun, and everyone is a little more spirited than usual in ghost-haunted Shenmen. The pulsing sweat and pouring blood, the songs, the race to beat the turn of seasons... all intended to remind both the living and dead of the tenacity of life—be it a life still being lived or one that exists only in a spirit’s memory. </p> <p>Even though the occupying forces of Lang Loi and her cronies think they have a stranglehold on spider-cursed Shenmen, First Long Night presents a quiet defiance, as people remember what it means to live for themselves and how often that requires shared commitments to mutual respect and survival. These tiny subversions lead to bolder ones; to survive haunted winters without official support, even the most law-abiding residents are willing to break the jorogumo occupiers’ laws to seek itinerant exorcists, bandit arms dealers, and wandering mercenaries to provide weapons or solutions to overcome the cold season’s undead threats. While the jorogumo normally consider these acts of asserting or accumulating power treasonous and punishable with excruciating death, for reasons known only to themselves, they don’t generally enforce such punishments near First Long Night.</p>"

Stone daggers are laid on the ground some distance away so that participants must first undo their own bindings, then dash to retrieve daggers, and finally run back to cut as many bundles free as they can within a time limit.</p> <p>Bundle-cutting evolved from training exercises to help villagers deal with being captured and bound by bandits or caught in woodland traps—techniques that are equally useful in escaping the webs of the giant spiders and similar creatures who have long posed dangers to the locals, even before jorogumo rule. Once a participant escapes their bindings, the cutting of other bindings represent swift action to rescue and release allies who have been bound. </p> <p>Such exercises, of course, have applications in overcoming the webbing of jorogumo as well.

They incorporate designs of fanciful shapes like birds (but never crows or ravens due to the famed jorogumo’s intense dislike of tengu), dragons, and other flying creatures.</p> <p>For a while, spiders were extremely popular motifs for lantern design, perhaps as a sign of flattery to the jorogumo overlords; however, that trend fell out of favor several years ago. Officials wishing to curry Lady Lang Loi’s favor sponsored a grand lantern making ceremony and commissioned a massive lantern shaped like a golden orb-weaver spider, which was so large as to eclipse even the harvest moon. This gigantic lantern eventually crashed in spectacular fashion. The ensuing conflagration burned down several buildings, but the collateral destruction of a large statue of Lady Lang Loi resulted in her public accusations and punishments against the officials and artisans involved, on charges of encouraging disrespect and fomenting rebellion.</p> <p>After such an inauspicious incident, most lantern making ceremonies have resumed their rural, less high-profile focus. In a fitting nod to its military, functional origins, villages now also use lantern making ceremonies for basic communications. While the jorogumo purge on scholarship has led to the loss of specialized knowledge like signaling techniques, it’s still possible to share simple yet vital information with released sky lanterns. On First Long Night, if the horizons are filled with flying lights, it reassures many to know their neighbors are still alive and able to construct sky lanterns. On the contrary, if a nearby village doesn’t release its own sky lanterns on this important festival, it’s very possible they’ve fallen to ghosts or worse. In such situations, neighboring villages might dispatch their bravest members to investigate, bring aid, and, if necessary, provide exorcisms for the unquiet dead.</p> <p>A lantern making ceremony involves two hours of designing and crafting lanterns, culminating in the lighting and release of them all at once; the winner of the contest is the one whose lantern evokes the most admiration from the spectators.</p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Lantern Making Ceremony</h2> <ul class=\"traits\"> <li class=\"trait\">Concentrate</li> <li class=\"trait\">Exploration</li> </ul> <p><strong>Skill Check</strong> @Check[crafting|dc:19|traits:concentrate,exploration|name:Lantern Making Ceremony]</p> </section>"

Wealthier kitchens stuff mooncakes with luxurious ingredients, such as osmanthus-infused lotus paste and salted eggs, while humbler pantries conjure simpler fare from salt, pepper, fried shallots, or crushed tangerine peel. A festival-goer typically travels with a small wicker basket on the belt to hold extra mooncakes.</p> <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Drinking with the Crickets</h2> <p>Villagers regularly feed crickets to spiders, hoping to discourage tattletales (represented by the noisy crickets) and symbolically satiate the jorogumo’s hungers. In fall, many leave tiny bowls of alcoholic grain-mush as overtures to these crickets’ spirits, both to beg forgiveness as well as give thanks for their roles as sacrificial proxies. Festival-goers often carry a few small gourd containers to carry alcohol so they can refill empty bowls as needed or, alternatively, small wicker cages that contain crickets that can be fed to spiders.</p> <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Lightly Armed</h2> <p>Weapons bearing magic that impart lasting illumination are popular for serving as light sources that can be used for defense as needed.

Most followers don’t see Sangpotshi as a belief that competes with worship of existing gods, but rather complements these faiths. The philosophy focuses on how to live a mortal life well. Some are skeptical about the practice, seeing it as an attempt to “cheat” the regular order of the afterlife, but Tian deities and their followers hold a different perspective. After all, reincarnation is as valid a judgment as any that a soul might face. Sangpotshi teaches followers that reincarnation is an exercise in conviction, for each life presents as many occasions to stray from one’s tenets as it does opportunities to improve oneself.</p> <p>Sangpotshi is also known as the River of Life. The name isn’t metaphorical—it describes a parallel to the River of Souls, which carries the souls of the dead to Pharasma’s Boneyard. Those who believe in reincarnation teach that these souls enter the River of Life instead, whose currents carry souls back to mortal life as many times as they’re destined to continue the cycle of rebirth. The cumulative effects of lived actions across all lives determine the circumstances of a soul’s next life. Tian deities, their representatives, and like-minded allies protect the River of Life from disruptive forces who would prey on souls in transit, but they don’t always succeed. The influence of supernatural manipulation or the taint of undeath can tear a soul from the cycle of reincarnation, transforming it into a nindoru—a destructive category of fiend that seeks to disrupt the cycle of reincarnation and to destroy the lasting works of mortal life by diverting a soul from its path to enlightenment into corruption and cruelty.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>Theories abound about what factors determine the lot of a reincarnated soul, and the most popular schools of thought exist as “paths,” each with unique practices. The <strong>Heavens Path</strong> originates from the teachings of Vudrani philosopher Bhoja Pandiri, who believed gods judge how mortals lived and assign their station in their next life.</p> <p>Adherents of the <strong>Earthly Path</strong> believe fate is a natural occurrence. Actions have observable consequences within a single lifetime, so the logical conclusion is fate follows the same rules across multiple lifetimes. How people treat each other is what matters most.</p> <p>The <strong>Traveler’s Path</strong> is the final major practice. Rather than focus on philosophical pursuits, the Traveler’s Path encourages the physical act of exploring the nature of existence. Adherents of this path find role models in the eponymous Sangpots, enlightened individuals who gained such a profound understanding of the universe that they merged with it.</p> <p>Some believe that the true nature of reincarnation lies somewhere between these various beliefs. A soul’s fate and destiny isn’t a quantifiable force that can be measured any more than one can measure the total amount of good will or suffering in existence. It can instead be best imagined as individual ledgers in which anyone can write an entry. The faithful servant of a deity might receive a positive entry from a divine representative, while a victim might place a debt on the ledger of their aggressor, and a criminal who feels intense guilt for their actions might leave a demerit on themselves long after society and their victims have forgiven them. It’s also up to those submitting entries to act on them, for there’s no objective outsider enforcing these judgments. It’s simply the sum of what people believe they owe each other and themselves, and the extent of their motivation to act on those beliefs.</p> <p>Such convictions might be the force that allows those who believe in reincarnation to choose to be born anew. The greatest heroes and villains throughout history are those who accomplished what they believed they must do. In that sense, fate is malleable, and each path can find substantial evidence to validate its teachings. The most powerful priests and mystics of every path claim to be able to see the fated connections an individual has accumulated with others all of their lifetimes. They follow those threads to understand patterns of behavior and cycles of reckoning between people. Their knowledge enables them to identify people’s deepest desires, arbitrate disputes between souls, and demand immediate fateful reckoning.</p> <p>Another key tenet of Sangpotshi is adherence to moderation. The end goal of Sangpotshi is to become an ideal version of oneself and to transcend mortal suffering. Sangpotshi mystics teach that suffering comes from desire. They don’t pass judgment on whether individual desires are good or bad, but they point out that desires create attachments to the mortal realm that cause souls to stagnate and suffer. Someone who becomes obsessed with a goal, for example, becomes unhappy if they can’t accomplish it. They might pursue their goal to the detriment of other aspects of their life. Alternatively, someone who achieves a desire might fear losing what they’ve acquired, focusing on preserving the status quo instead of being satisfied with what they possess.</p> <p>Spurning desire doesn’t mean abandoning life goals or societal responsibilities. Sangpotshi frowns on those who abandon their obligations to avoid attachments, viewing that as its own extreme, though followers sometimes choose to set aside their circumstances if doing so doesn’t harm others. The philosophy instead provides guidance on how to live well within one’s circumstances and settle one’s spiritual accounts. That guidance includes not diving too deeply into past lives. Most followers of Sangpotshi believe there’s a reason people—samsarans excluded—don’t remember their previous lives. They understand that rebirth gives them an opportunity to wipe their slate clean and shed attachments that have run their course or become unhealthy. Sangpotshi mystics prize their ability to access information about prior incarnations but are careful to use it in moderation. They only peek into the past when they believe it’s relevant to a problem plaguing someone in the present.</p>"

                            "text": "<p>People in Tian Xia sometimes seek out a Sangpotshi mystic when they encounter difficulties in their life to learn if those difficulties are the result of a spiritual connection. Some types of these relationships occur frequently and are common knowledge in most Tian Xia cultures. Individuals tend to encounter the same people who impacted them in prior incarnations. </p> <p>Kindred ties arise from those who developed strong connections in previous lives, though the nature of those connections varies. They might have been family, close friends, or compatriots, such as farmers working communal land together or soldiers fighting in the same warband. These relationships can be propitious or antagonistic. Two friends who took care of each other throughout a previous life could now have a propitious relationship as spouses or parent and child. Those same relationships can also be antagonistic due to a spiritual debt. Perhaps a con artist stole someone’s life savings, causing their premature death—that relationship can manifest in the next life as a spouse or child who causes great financial loss. Such a loss can be deliberate, such as through theft, or indirect, such as due to a health crisis.</p> <p>Mystics are careful to warn people not to use spiritual relationships as an excuse to justify resentment, nor to make assumptions about what spiritual bonds exist. Going back to the previous antagonistic example, a spouse who steals could be subconsciously taking revenge for a theft in a previous life, or they could be starting a new cycle of anger and resentment where none existed before.</p> <p>Friendships can be the start of new relationships or the recurrence of weaker spiritual bonds. Ephemeral friendships might be due to a single spiritual bond from a previous life that results in the souls parting once resolved. Perhaps two strangers came to someone’s aid in a previous life. They become study partners in their next life under the tutelage of the soul they helped, and when they learn the skills they need to attain their dream jobs, they then drift apart.</p> <p>A good destiny can improve one’s position at birth. A great hero from a previous life might be born into a wealthy family in the next because of the good will they incurred from many other souls. The past doesn’t dictate the future, though, and Sangpotshi warns that you should respect people for their behavior, not their status. A wealthy heir could become cruel and greedy in their new life because they lack empathy for others.</p> <p>Sangpotshi followers believe some births into bad situations result from fate, but they again warn that it’s dangerous to make such assumptions. Some powerful mystics choose to reincarnate into difficult circumstances because it can cause their powers to manifest more quickly. Other souls that are close to becoming Sangpots take oaths of self-sacrifice, choosing to suffer ill fortune to prevent it from falling on innocent souls. The assignment of souls into new bodies is unknowable in many respects. A fallen branch can choose where it washes ashore no more than a soul in the River of Life chooses where it reenters life. Fate can improve one’s odds of being born into certain circumstances or encountering specific events in one’s life, but it never guarantees such occurrences.</p> <p>How one responds to their current situation is the most important aspect of Sangpotshi and fate. Receive good fortune with humility and face trouble with a positive attitude. Sangpotshi tells people to do good whenever possible, exercise good judgment, and live by the rule of treating others as you would want others to treat you.</p>"

Take the example of a worker under an oppressive boss. Such a person might seek out a mystic and ask if the boss oppresses them because of something they did in a past life. The answer might be no, in which case the worker might feel free to leave their situation to find a better working environment.</p> <p>If the answer is yes, the worker might find comfort in knowing their suffering has a purpose and stay so that they can end their spiritual debt. If they leave, they could find themselves working under the boss again in the future or, worse, become related to them in a future life where they can’t escape their debt so easily. Perhaps the mystic sees that their troubles will only last another year, and if they wait it out, their relationship with their boss will improve or the boss will leave. The mystic might also see another way to resolve the debt, such as telling them why their boss is so angry, enabling the person to confront their boss and resolve their problems directly.

Its texts describe cycles that mirror life, death, and rebirth—the rise and fall of civilizations, the renewal of nature after a disaster, and the familiar behaviors people fall back on when confronted with change.</p> <p>Some cycles are constructive and should be preserved, but others perpetuate suffering that might not be within the power of individuals to break. Even negative cycles can help souls grow toward eventual enlightenment, with the difficulties that arise from constant economic peril being one such example. Nonetheless, those who follow Sangpotshi agree that, without a doubt, poverty causes immense suffering and should be counteracted. At the same time, fate dictates that different behaviors and beliefs lead to unequal outcomes. Followers of Sangpotshi do what lies within their power to combat inequality while accepting that one must live with the reality of its existence. They encourage those who lament their situation to examine what they can learn from their experiences. This introspection can lead to enlightenment and change. If everyone treats each other well, they might eventually eliminate poverty. Sangpotshi’s guidelines help followers nurture positive cycles and escape or counter negative ones.</p> <p>Followers are also careful to protect the balance between the natural and urbanized worlds. They see all living creatures as on the same path and treat them with the dignity they would want to receive in turn. Helping others is a duty, though they’re careful to assist in ways that allow others to learn and grow rather than become reliant on external aid. They promote sustainable methods of living, taking only what one needs and in ways that minimize harm. Such choices aim to preserve existing cycles so that future generations have access to the same opportunities that past ones did. This desire to preserve and uplift means that violence is a last resort, but it isn’t anathema. Destructive forces seek to corrupt the cycle of reincarnation, and Sangpotshi followers defend the River of Life through all means at their disposal.</p>"

Corruption runs so deep within them that their yearning for what they’ve lost becomes twisted, manifesting as an appetite for reincarnated souls above all others.</p> <p>The fiends aren’t completely isolated from creation, though. They can amplify their selfish thoughts to manifest objects or even minions that serve them alone. The most powerful can manifest entire societies or realms from only their thoughts. Nindorus treat these creations as prized possessions but forget about them as soon as they’re destroyed. Some scholars see this behavior as a mockery of reincarnation, drawing a parallel between an individual’s life and the ephemeral existence of a fiend’s tool. Such speculation comes from nindorus behaving as the destructive opposites of Sangpotshi mystics. They have access to similar repertoires of occult spells, and they tend to stalk temples and boundaries between nature and civilization—the same places Sangpotshi mystics often patrol. Critics of such theories point out that those locations are also where nindorus can find their preferred prey and insist that base instincts drive nindorus, dismissing the notion that they have any organized purpose.</p> <p>See @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap19707advent.JournalEntryPage.07nindoru0000000] for more information about nindorus.

It activates when you drink it, which uses it up. Magic tea has the potion and tea traits. When you craft a dose of magic tea, the raw materials you supply are in the form of unusual and costly tea leaves. The process of crafting magic tea includes infusing the leaves with magical reagents, purifying the water, and steeping the tea in the water, resulting in what’s essentially a particularly delicious-tasting potion. You can activate magic tea with an Interact action as you drink it or feed it to another creature, as if it were a potion. You can also activate magic tea with a 10-minute activity that requires sterling tea ware (these artisan’s tools can be shared by up to four people who take this activity simultaneously) to prepare the tea and then consume it or present it to someone during a short tea ceremony, after which the magic tea’s effects begin; activating magic tea in this way enhances its effect, as detailed in each entry’s Tea Ceremony below. </p> <p>Once you drink a dose of magic tea, you’re temporarily immune to that particular type of magic tea for 24 hours.</p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.ByaYlK0QmnqEbCE2]</span><span>Item 3</span></h2> </section> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.RK03uy9os4H0dUfS]</span><span>Item 4</span></h2> </section> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.n5xlR7ApXgfJRkbF]</span><span>Item 3</span></h2> </section> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Sq4MIaXhb2zcCT6y]</span><span>Item 9</span></h2> </section> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Cz0XxRVMma7cllCd]</span><span>Item 6</span></h2> </section> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.qyjaueXduvCUeDbp]</span><span>Item 5</span></h2> </section> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.EMviiUBFb5hB1X5Q]</span><span>Item 7</span></h2> </section>"

Still, they do their best to ensure that undead they animate aren’t left to wander free.

With each passing year, the feline becomes more and more monstrous—growing in size, becoming more intelligent, and gaining an affinity for magic. Eventually, they become able to walk upright on their rear legs, pursue new hobbies, and learn languages. Despite this expanded intellect, many bakenekos prefer to enjoy the first decades of their ascension continuing their lives as usual as a (particularly oversized) house cat. For some, they do so because they want to acquire knowledge of the world that they couldn’t comprehend as cats, but for others, it’s just a desire to live out their lives with their current families and loved ones before moving on to what comes next.</p> <p>Bakenekos enjoy dancing above all other pleasures and can’t resist nodding their heads, tapping their paws, or swishing their tails in time to music. They often animate corpses simply to watch them dance—a pastime that often spells trouble for nearby settlements should the undead get free from the bakeneko’s control. Bakenekos typically have a playful and mischievous demeanor, and while they aren’t inherently evil creatures, they’re still feared for their ability to animate corpses and command fire. Villagers are often frightened half to death by the sight of a flaming cat strolling alongside a walking corpse, and bakenekos’ association with evil and the occult has caused some villages in Tian Xia to vilify all cats.</p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.BK4gQmGPX4BW4hyb]</span><span>Creature 3</span></h2> </section>"

A guhdggi always carries a large wicker cage strapped to their back, while dozens of cords and straps affix a trove of broken weapons, tools, and items to their belly and flanks. When they walk, they do so with the aid of two long spears clutched in their forearms, stumbling and hopping in an ungainly gait. The most unsettling feature of the guhdggi is its second face, revealed when the frog-like mouth opens to reveal a human face peering from its throat amid a tangled nest of butterflies. This face has long, dark, animated hair capable of inflicting painful lashes, the lengths of which hang from the corner of the frog’s mouth when its lips are closed.</p> <p>While the guhdggi is no longer capable of movement as swift as most humanoids walk, they still enjoy traveling while harboring a ferocious jealousy of those who can do so with greater ease.

Ultimately, to Xin Yue, the actual form of their body was unimportant as long as their soul remained whole.</p> <p>As a follower of Sangpotshi, each lifetime they lived saw them growing ever-nearer to enlightenment. They befriended long-lived spirits who were always happy for them to visit in their latest body. As their lives continued on, they eventually attained enlightenment.

In these dreams, Xin Yue and Kugaptee increasingly engaged in lively debates over the value of reincarnation, and over time, this corruption grew to the point that Xin Yue dedicated herself to the nindoru demigod, whom she had come to consider as the Lord who “opened her eyes to the frivolity of enlightenment.”</p> <p>Xin Yue then turned her attention to the few remaining monks at the monastery and began to lure them over to the worship of Kugaptee. However, it wasn’t until Xin Yue offered herself as a sacrifice to the fiend before the other monks’ eyes—only to be reincarnated into her current body—that they converted as well. To them, Xin Yue had revealed that the Tan Sugi monastery wasn’t a place for peace, but a cage-tomb that, if they could release its bound prisoner, would grant great power and rewards immediately, rather than waiting for countless reincarnations through a chance at something they might never even earn.</p> <p>Xin Yue’s current body has the form of a human woman with a short build, shoulder-length cropped hair and a long black braid that hangs to her calves. She strikes fearful respect into her followers by saying terrible things with a cheery attitude and a kind smile on her face. Always polite even as she threatens and promises punishment, her politeness isn’t a facade. Even while butchering her victims in the most prolonged and painful way possible, she smiles at them and earnestly thanks them for their sacrifice.</p> <p>When Governor Heh Shan-Bao’s ritual slew the people of Willowshore and plunged the region into a mindscape, Xin Yue and her monks perished as well. However, they didn’t return to life within the mindscape. Their proximity and devotion to Kugaptee kept them from life, and they’ve spent each cycle of the past 115 years as undead. To Xin Yue, this new body is a shameful and horrific burden, and she only hopes that by helping Kugaptee to achieve what he desires—using the incarnation of his old enemy’s body, now the sugi tree that grows over his grave, as the raw building blocks of a new living body—that she too shall be reborn into a new body. She has little interest in what kind of body she might attain, just that it be one of living flesh.</p> <h2>Campaign Role</h2> <p>Xin Yue fabricated the circumstances for the Tan Sugi monastery to fall and for Kugaptee to awaken, and she has been working toward his revival ever since. Like the heroes, Xin Yue has been trapped in the mindscape for the past 115 years, but due to her connection with Kugaptee, she has retained the memories of each passing cycle. She has kept tabs on the townsfolk of Willowshore, but after a century of repeated failures to break their own cycle, she discounted them as a threat to her work. As such, she was truly surprised when she received a vision from Kugaptee that showed the PCs opening the Wall of Ghosts.</p> <p>Despite her nearly skeletal, undead appearance, Xin Yue continues to foster her politeness; she doesn’t hide her intent in any way. She has no personal grudge against the heroes. Although she might come across as reasonable, as long as Kugaptee’s presence remains within the mindscape, she can’t be reasoned with to stop her pursuits and will fight to the bitter end to achieve her goal. </p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.ExTKQvgLI72XGk98]</span><span>Creature 7</span></h2> </section>"

Rather than succumb to monsters, Zhi Hui was instead discovered and raised by kami. She followed their guidance and achieved enlightenment at the age of 15 before setting out on her own to explore Specterwood. Years later, she heard the story of a grove of sugi trees that towered over the rest of the forest, with trunks as large as entire huts. Wondering how sugi trees could grow to such extremes, Zhi Hui set out to find the grove. It took her three more years to find the trees, for this part of Specterwood was wild and unexplored, but she knew she’d come across a place of immense significance even if she didn’t yet know what it meant.</p> <p>When Zhi Hui initially founded both the Tan Sugi monastery and Willowshore, she’d simply hoped to create a place where disciples of Sangpotshi could dedicate their lives to the pursuit enlightenment. The sugi grove instilled a sense of awe in her, and she discovered that a high concentration of spiritual energy caused the trees to grow abnormally large. She soon uncovered the grove’s sinister secret—that a great evil slumbered beneath its roots and only the spiritual resistance of a heroic soul who had reincarnated as the tallest tree in the grove kept that evil from escaping its death. Following this discovery, she scoured the resources available to her and reached out to friends throughout Tian Xia before finally determining the nature of the evil. A nindoru demigod named Kugaptee was buried beneath the Great Sugi, and she dedicated herself to protecting the sugi trees that in turn protected all of the villagers from the fiend.</p> <p>After Master Zhi Hui’s passing, her spirit initially remained tied to the monastery to oversee the protection of the grove, but as her followers left or became corrupted, her spirit became trapped in Kugaptee’s clutches as well. Now, she can do little to stop the events that unfold and are leading to a dire situation: Kugaptee’s awakening.</p> <h2>Campaign Role</h2> <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/art/PZO90197 zhihui.webp\" alt=\"Zhi Hui, benevolant monastic ghost\" title=\"Zhi Hui\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap197-let-the-leaves-fall/assets/art/PZO90197 zhihui.webp')\" /> <p>As the PCs purify statues in the monastery, Zhi Hui can answer more of their questions and cast spells on them; once all four statues are purified, she can cast spells and answer questions at will and can even aid in combat as long as the fight takes place in one of the encounter areas that contains a purified statue. Certain questions the PCs might ask Zhi Hui are answered as follows. </p> <p><strong>Who/What is Kugaptee?</strong> “Kugaptee is a nindoru fiend whose existence stands in opposition to the philosophy of Sangpotshi. Nearly a thousand years ago, he was defeated by Tan Sui-Jing. She perished in the fight as well, but her soul reincarnated as a towering sugi tree that grew over Kugaptee’s remains, serving as a seal that would keep his soul trapped. The central sugi tree in this monastery is that very tree. But it has sickened, for Kugaptee strives for rebirth. His influence is the source of the monstrosities you’ve been facing. This monastery was once a sacred place, with monks who cared for the land, the animals, and the spirits. At the same time, and even before the monastery, it has been a site that kept Kugaptee’s immense evil sealed away beneath the surface. I had hoped that this monastery would stand guard over Kugaptee’s grave for many generations to come, but I failed to see how my own death would affect my followers. No one was ready to take my place. Worse, one of my students, Xin Yue, became corrupted by Kugaptee, and even now toils below in his grave to see the fiend’s soul reborn. Now, the fiends who have gathered here have been desecrating the statues scattered throughout the monastery to amplify Kugaptee’s influence.”</p> <p><strong>What can you tell us of the curse that afflicts Willowshore?</strong> “This monastery was built in this sacred grove of trees, but unknown to me at the time, the Great Sugi seals away a powerful and evil fiend named Kugaptee. It is this fiend’s influence that has caused the tragedy unfolding now. It is no mere curse that traps you and Willowshore. Time itself has been stolen from you. We are all trapped in a cycling mindscape that repeats every year, beginning on the first day of summer and ending on the last day of spring. Each time the cycle repeats, your memories have been reset. I retain my memories, but I know not how often the cycle has repeated, and until now have not been able to see further than Kugaptee’s darkness. But I know who started it—your governor, Heh Shan-Bao. He sought to bolster the Tan Sugi, but it needed no bolstering. His attempt backfired and opened cracks into Kugaptee’s grave—cracks that plunged us all into this cyclic mindscape. It was enough to whisk Heh Shan-Bao away even from this mindscape that traps the rest of us. While I cannot say how many years we’ve repeated this cycle, I do know that something has changed this time—whether due to Kugaptee’s growing strength or other outside forces. What is important is that you have been given the chance to change our fates, and you must not waste this opportunity if you wish to free us all. To stop the cycle, you must uncover the truth of what happened, and that begins with ending Kugaptee’s influence over this mindscape.”</p> <p><strong>How can we escape?</strong> “I do not know the answer you seek. If anyone does, it would be Heh Shan-Bao. He caused of all this, but he is now trapped within his own mindscape. Once Kugaptee’s influence has been diminished, there will be trails to follow and clues to seek that will surely lead you to where your governor has gone. Find Heh Shan-Bao and you will get closer to understanding what is happening now and how to escape from this cycle of malice.”</p> <section class=\"action\"> <h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.season-of-ghosts-bestiary.Actor.uFg1TnTBpXNYGF9o]</span><span>Creature 7</span></h2> </section>"

The fungus actually shares a symbiotic relationship with the slime mold, serving as an external digestive system while gaining access to the nutrients it needs. The ooze remains perfectly still until living prey passes within reach, then it lashes out with disgusting pseudopods. With a touch, a slime mold can infect its prey with a foul contagion known as slime rot, a horrific disease that painfully breaks down a victim's flesh. At first, the disease manifests as painful rashes and agonized joints. In the later stages, though, the flesh of the affected creature actually begins to liquefy and run in rivulets as the creature's spores continue to work. Death, when it occurs, swiftly causes the resulting body to split open and release a brand new slime mold.</p><hr /><p>Due to their bizarre physical structures and ability to break down and feed on a wide variety of materials, oozes are able to adapt to nearly any climate, especially when assisted by magical or alchemical tinkering.

Born from souls who were once enlightened but then renounced it and their role in the cycle of reincarnation, they curse the futility of their existence and find pleasure in leading others to the same fate.</p><p>Ijdas appear as towering humanoids, their bodies bloated and constantly bursting with small red butterflies that flitter away before melting into mist. Their arms are overly long and so broken as to writhe more like tentacles, affording them an unsettling combat style with greater reach than most large creatures enjoy. They wear clothing and capes made of moldy straw and wield broken swords whose shattered blades still float roughly in place. Their most unsettling features are their complete lack of heads; instead, where a head should be sits a wicker cage filled with a writhing cloud of butterflies. Yet still, they see, hear, and speak without issue, as if their heads remained in place.</p><p>Formed without heads or even brains, an idja's mind is shared among the flocks of butterflies in their head cages or bursting from their bodies, and as each of these insects escapes and fades away, these forgetful fiends lose another potential thought. Unable to learn new things, any actions they take stem from memories etched into their souls or directives they blindly follow from other nindorus or creatures they've come to accept as superiors. Their movements, words, and reactions are all conducted via a type of muscle memory based on how their souls believe they should respond to their external stimuli. As a result, most now serve as brutal guardians, since their forgetfulness also prevents them from being able to sleep.</p><hr /><p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p><p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p><p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p><h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2><p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p><h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2><p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p><h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2><p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p><h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2><p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p><h2>Other Nindorus</h2><p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>",

If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p><h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2><p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p><h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2><p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p><h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2><p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p><h2>Other Nindorus</h2><p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>",

It moves in a manner similar to that of the more common sidewinder snake, throwing its body forward in a loop and anchoring itself by keeping one head or the other on the ground at all times.</p><p>Amphisbaenas' typical prey includes rabbits, foxes, various birds, small deer, and even humanoids if presented the opportunity. Fiercely territorial by nature, they attack just about anything that gets near their lairs, regardless of the intruder's size. Many a child has been warned about going too far into the woods alone, lest they wander too close to an amphisbaena den and become the creature's next meal.</p><p>The venom of an amphisbaena is incredibly potent, able to take down a stout dwarf within minutes if left untreated. However, it also has uses in a variety of healing remedies, which makes it a valuable commodity if collected. For example, a pregnant person might be advised to drink the venom in small, dilute doses to help safeguard the pregnancy. Mixing small amounts of the venom with various herbs and oil creates a poultice which dulls aches and pains. As a result, the image of an amphisbaena appears in many contexts associated with healing and alchemical subjects, such as labels for tinctures, annotations in herbalists' records, and illustrations in textbooks of medicine.</p><p>The first amphisbaena is said to have formed from the blood that fell as a medusa's head was severed. This story's origin most likely stems from the fact that amphisbaenas are oddly immune to petrification, which in turn leads to them sometimes being kept as pets by a medusa. A medusa who keeps an amphisbaena as a pet might regard the viper as their most treasured companion or perhaps even as their own child. Despite these fabled supernatural origins and the occasional special treatment they receive, however, amphisbaenas are entirely mundane animals with only rudimentary intelligence and no innate magical abilities whatsoever.</p>",

Often grouping in committees of four or five, these scavengers wheel above battles and plague-stricken towns, eager to feed. This feeding cycle plays an important role, especially in hot regions, as their particularly potent stomach acid neutralizes dangerous bacteria in their meals and thus removes it from the environment.</p><p>A giant vulture has a wingspan of up to 25 feet across and weighs up to 600 pounds. Less common than their smaller cousins, they typically live in areas that support a number of megafauna species. While imposing and certainly dangerous when provoked, even giant vultures are not hostile by nature, preferring to feast on the kills of others. They are more likely to vomit their last meal as a distraction while they flee than to attack other creatures. However, during particularly lean times, starving groups of giant vultures might work in unison to make a meal of livestock.</p><p>Giant vultures occasionally form parasitic relationships with larger creatures such as dragons or giants, picking at the remains of an unattended or forgotten meal. Crafters who use bones in their work have come to value this type of behavior. Flensing a creature properly is far slower than letting a committee of vultures strip the carcass and leave behind a clean skeleton. As food-motivated predators, younger vultures raised this way can be made to imprint upon owners, leading to a trend of keeping them as unusual pets.</p><p>While not magical in nature, vulture talons are traditionally used as charms in healing and removing disease, stemming from an old belief that the raptors were immune to the filth in which they strode. While this belief isn't strictly true, vultures do have several unique adaptations to avoid common diseases that would take out predators or even other scavengers. Due to their size, giant vulture talons in particular are sometimes used to craft weapons in regions where other resources are scarce.</p>",

Through the use of these powers, they seek to drag all existence down into a pit of hopelessness and despair, and to commit all souls to oblivion.</p><p>While those who summon daemons to the Material Plane usually seek to use the creatures' destructive and corrupting powers for their own ends, daemons always look for ways to spread fear, doubt, and despair wherever they go. Often, daemons disguise their plots as the workings of other fiends, knowing that such confusion compounds mortals' fear.</p><p>While all fiends seek to tempt mortals into lives of evil to increase their own numbers and power on their native planes, daemons are further driven by a supernatural hunger for mortal souls and use a variety of methods-not least of which is the cacodaemons' soul gems-to entrap them. On Abaddon and in other forbidding places across the multiverse, souls are simultaneously a delicacy, a trade good, and a source of magical power, and the daemons are among the greatest gluttons, merchants, and abusers of this spiritual \"resource.\"</p>",

Eventually, they become able to walk upright on their rear legs, pursue new hobbies, and learn languages. Despite this expanded intellect, many bakenekos prefer to enjoy the first decades of their ascension continuing their lives as usual as a (particularly oversized) house cat. For some, they do so because they want to acquire knowledge of the world that they couldn't comprehend as cats, but for others, it's just a desire to live out their lives with their current families and loved ones before moving on to what comes next.</p><p>Bakenekos enjoy dancing above all other pleasures and can't resist nodding their heads, tapping their paws, or swishing their tails in time to music. They often animate corpses simply to watch them dance—a pastime that often spells trouble for nearby settlements should the undead get free from the bakeneko's control. Bakenekos typically have a playful and mischievous demeanor, and while they aren't inherently evil creatures, they're still feared for their ability to animate corpses and command fire.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p><p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p><p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>",

To sojiruhs, the sound of a perfect scream from the body it feeds upon is akin to the perfect wine pairing with dinner.</p><p>A sojiruh's mouth is stitched shut with lengths of its own hair. Despite this, they can speak freely, their hollow-sounding voices issuing clearly from sealed lips. They only stretch these stitches when they choose to shriek and scream. Their arms are long and broken-looking, while their chests are little more than rib cages filled with red wet butterflies that crawl through and cling to the creature's ribs and organs. When a sojiruh screams, the wings of the butterflies in its chest flutter frantically.</p><p>Sojiruhs symbolize the cycle of reincarnation come undone from its purity and becoming mired in decay and corruption.</p><hr /><p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p><p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p><p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p><h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2><p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p><h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2><p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p><h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2><p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p><h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2><p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p><h2>Other Nindorus</h2><p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>",

                    "publicNotes": "<p>A guhdggi forms from the corrupted reincarnated souls of those who have trod the same pilgrimage route through multiple lives. This type of nindoru looks like a bloated frog with long, slender human arms instead of front feet. Its eyes appear bulbous and blind yet are capable of sight. A guhdggi always carries a large wicker cage strapped to their back, while dozens of cords and straps affix a trove of broken weapons, tools, and items to their belly and flanks. When they walk, they do so with the aid of two long spears clutched in their forearms, stumbling and hopping in an ungainly gait. The most unsettling feature of the guhdggi is its second face, revealed when the frog-like mouth opens to reveal a human face peering from its throat amid a tangled nest of butterflies. This face has long, dark, animated hair capable of inflicting painful lashes, the lengths of which hang from the corner of the frog's mouth when its lips are closed.</p><p>While the guhdggi is no longer capable of movement as swift as most humanoids walk, they still enjoy traveling while harboring a ferocious jealousy of those who can do so with greater ease. One would do well not to underestimate the stumbling stagger of a guhdggi, though! The fiend particularly delights in lying in wait along isolated sections of pilgrimage routes to ambush travelers, trapping victims in their cages and feeding upon their captive's mind and memories of previously visited places.</p><p>Guhdggis embody the cycles of repeated journeys and the concept that every journey taken ends at the start of the next. Central to this concept is the notion that no journey ever truly begins or ends—they just emerge from the previous one.</p><hr /><p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p><p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p><p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p><h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2><p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p><h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2><p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p><h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2><p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p><h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2><p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p><h2>Other Nindorus</h2><p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>",

                    "publicNotes": "<p>A sojiruh comes into existence when a creature who has dedicated multiple lives to achieving enlightenment turns their back on these goals and deliberately tears themselves away from the cycle of reincarnation before their death. These monstrous creatures are the most common nindoru and are also the most hated by followers of Sangpotshi, since so many of these fiends rise from fallen members of that very philosophy.</p><p>This type of nindoru relishes the flavor of an oft-reincarnated soul and finds this life force tastes best when consumed while the physical body still lives and screams. To sojiruhs, the sound of a perfect scream from the body it feeds upon is akin to the perfect wine pairing with dinner.</p><p>A sojiruh's mouth is stitched shut with lengths of its own hair. Despite this, they can speak freely, their hollow-sounding voices issuing clearly from sealed lips. They only stretch these stitches when they choose to shriek and scream. Their arms are long and broken-looking, while their chests are little more than rib cages filled with red wet butterflies that crawl through and cling to the creature's ribs and organs. When a sojiruh screams, the wings of the butterflies in its chest flutter frantically.</p><p>Sojiruhs symbolize the cycle of reincarnation come undone from its purity and becoming mired in decay and corruption.</p><hr /><p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p><p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p><p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p><h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2><p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p><h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2><p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p><h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2><p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p><h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2><p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p><h2>Other Nindorus</h2><p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>",
